         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Since my enlargement I was a long time occupied partlye in flanders, partlye in Paris about ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary buſines well knowen to many, ſo that I had ſmall reſpite to reade ouer that which M. Abbots had written aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2473:6"/> mee. At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth coming to haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leaſure, (albeit I haue neuer ſince bin free from the ſame care) and not willing to ſpend my ſpare time idly, but to ſet in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with ſome peece of worke I was by my graue and vnderſtanding frinds adviſed, to begin with a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſame booke, as coming forth lateſt, and being indeed the only booke wich M. Abbot had labored in defence of himſelf againſt mee. I at my louing frinds inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce peruſing ouer that booke more diligentlie, found it fuller of words, tauntes and cauills, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of weightie and ſound matter: and would therfore rather haue made choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of ſome other booke of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; not making anie great reckning of his vntrue imputations and bitter ſpeeches againſt my ſelf. bicauſe the moſt honorable prelates of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, and beſt deſerving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (whoſe bookes I am not Worthie to carrie after them) writing againſt bitter and broadmouthed Heretikes, never lightlie eſcaped better cheape: for what theſe mild hornets wanted in ſound reaſonnig, that they were wont to ſupplie in foule railing. My kind
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2473:6"/> frinds replied, that how litle account ſoeuer I made of mine owne intereſt, yet M. Abbot being now growen a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of name, and choſen for the divinitie reader in the famous vniuerſitie of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that ought not to bee contemned which hee and his frinds deemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the print. Beſides he pretendeth it to bee a peece of great price, long premeditated, and eſteemed by him a mater worthie a large treatiſe, and therfore not to bee lett paſſe as a thing of naught without an anſwer.</p>
               <p>whervpon in part, and withall to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that in my booke which hee cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth at as leaſt iuſtifiable belike, (for he doth not anſwere it orderlie as it lieth, though it were but a litle one, but picketh out certen parcelles) I in fine reſolued to examine brieflie the weight and worth of that his booke, which hee ſurnameth <hi>à counterproofe,</hi> not vnproperlie: bicauſe hee doth in it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie often hunt the counter, (as they ſay) that is, rather runne vp and downe, forward and backward, turne this waie and that waie verie idly and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, then fall to any ſerious proofe, or purſue the points in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> directlie.</p>

               <p>Notwithſtanding I will not deale with M.

               <p>Having in few words shewed the reaſons that moued mee to vndergoe this worke, and the method that I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to obſerue therin, without anie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preface I will preſentlie come to M. Abbots Epiſtle Dedicatorie: in the

                  <p>M. Abbot (as he here ſaies) would not haue anſwered my litle book howſoeuer it was to purpoſe, had it not fallen within the compas of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pretended treatiſe of his owne: how much leſſe cauſe haue I to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my hand from more ſerious and ſubſtantiall worke, to giue anſwer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his long tedious trifling bookes? that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2473:14"/> mans head that should not ake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore M. Abbot had ſoundly proued the now Roman church, to be in any one pointe of faith eſtranged from the old; were like to liue many a faire day without need of a Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Hee hath shewed his good will I confeſſe by giuing the eſſay: but hath done litle more therby, then bewrayed how vnable he is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. ſo that one may wonder at his ſimplicity (shall I ſay) or at his audacity, or rather at both? at his ſimplicitie, for wanting wit to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand when it was ſo plainlie told him how impertinentlie he dealeth in the matter. At his audacity, if ſeing his rash and raw Enterpriſe ſucceed no better, he would neuertheles hold on ſtill and proceed farther.</p>
                  <p>Let it bee by the waie obſerued that M. Abbots intention was and is to deſcribe, <hi>the true Roman Catholike:</hi> for that you shall heare him hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the heate of diſputation verie buſie to proue, that there is ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible repugnance betwene the very tearmes <hi>Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2473:15"/> become a Roman Prieſt: he to eſcape miſerie, crept into the Miniſtery. I wittingly and willinglie made my ſelf therby vncapable of all ſpirituall liuings and promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which our noble coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie doth afford in great plentie vnto men of the Church. he contrarywiſe as it ſeemeth, followed the ſtudie of new diuinity, to fill himſelf with fat benefices, if the greedie apperite which his former penurie bred in him, can be ſatisfied. for hauing three or foure liuings already, he is thought to gape ſtill after ſome greater. In a word I doe ſtriue to walke in the narrow and hard path of faſting, praier and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie from all corporall pleaſures: he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth at large following the carnall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Luthers Ghoſpell of wiuing, eating, &amp; fulfilling the deſires of the flesh.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2473:17"/> his nonage (for the iudgment of thoſe high ſupernaturall points of religion do belong rather to the vocation of godly and graue learned Bishops, than to youthfull princes:) yet to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout imbracer and à zealous maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly <hi>ingraffed word</hi> which only can ſaue our ſoules: for the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce wherof the glorious title of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the faith, was annexed to the crowne of England.

                  <p>From his deuotious and charity ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his profeſſion, let vs paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hope expreſſed in this paſſage. his hope was that Prince Henries hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hnes should haue a chief part in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2473:18"/> ſuppreſſing of this Roman religion. Maie he not now (as once he told mee) crie out with the no-vaine poet: <hi>O ſpes fallaces,</hi> o falſe and deceitfull hopes; o vaine confidence in earthly creatures, be they neuer ſo noble and powerfull. good reaſon hath he to do ſo, ſeing he would not harken vnto the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet when he ſaid:<note place="margin">

                  <p>I come now to the new article of M.

But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſeemeth to be rather a kind of prophecy, then anie article of faith: why maie not M.

Some likelihoods there bee (I grant) in worldly mens opinions, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion may be rooted out of England. but when we lift vp our harts to heauen, and weigh well the true qualities and nature of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we ſee noe euident cauſe to feare any ſuch imminent daunger: nay wee diſcouer rather motiues to perſwade vs to the contrarie, to witt, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and the reſtauration of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion in our country is neere at hand.</p>
                  <p>Not to anſwer M.

And all men of meanes being once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerished, neither prieſts (who by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, adminiſtration of Sacraments, and good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of life are great prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and ſtaies of religion) can be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured and interteined; nor poore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſuccoured and relieued: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Firſt (ſaith hee) I haue challenged the name Catholike from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish vſe, and proued that the papiſts could no more take that title to them, but by meere vſurpation. Afterward I entred into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon conſiſting of three partes. wherof the firſt was to declare, that neither S. Pauls, nor S. Peters Epiſtles, conteine anie defence of the doctrine now taught at Rome. the ſecond, that ſundrie definitions of the ancient Roman faith, were wholie agreeable to that which the proteſtants teach, and is impugned by the church of Rome that now is. the third and laſt was to proue, that ſundrie hereſies condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of old by the Roman church, be now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the ſame church of Rome.</p>

               <p>which pointes being (as euerie man ſeeth) all and euerie one, of marvellous great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet M.

Concerning which hideous out-cry of my falſifications, I refer thee to the aduertiſment which I haue added to the third part of that defence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I haue ſcourged him accordingly.</hi> this is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of M.

Abbot is to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2473:39"/> himſelf in his owne iudgment about his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne worke. here he ſaith (as you haue heard) that he did ſett downe in his anſwere to my Epiſtle, thoſe three branches of compariſon betweene the ancient and moderne church of Rome, onlie poſitiuely: yeelding alſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bicauſe the occaſion then required no more. yet whoſoeuer pleaſeth to reade his preface of the ſame<note n="a" place="margin">defenſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</note> worke to the reader, shall find him there to ſpeake in an other keie. <hi>I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue</hi> (ſaith hee there) <hi>had care to giue the reader ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the queſtions heere diſcuſſed</hi> (of w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich theſe compariſons were a great part) <hi>and to ſtop the aduerſaries mouth, that hee maie haue no thing further to replie. I haue according to Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians rule, endevored to make truth to vſe all her ſtrength. I haue taken time conuenient to levie ſuch troupes and bands, that I maie not need to doubt of the victorie.</hi> compare theſe places togither, and tell mee whether they bee not plaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie? <hi>to handle queſtions poſitiuelie and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: And to treate of them ſo fullie, and in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite manner, that to the verie aduerſarie nothing should be left to replie.</hi> there he wrote, that hee tooke convenient leaſure to leavie ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and bandes, that hee needed not to doubt of victory. here having ſeene his ſaid troupes and bands haraſſed and defeated, hee is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, and vpon better adviſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that his former furniture was ſlender, and that hee handled the matter but ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie. whether of theſe should the good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beleeue? both hee cannot, being ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2473:39"/> the one <hi>to the other. yet being one and the ſame</hi> great Doctor that hath ſett downe both in print, and recomended both to his reader; he may hap to ſtagger, which of them he is to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke for true. M. Abbot ſo highlie magnified there, his vttermoſt endevor to diſcuſſe thoſe matters plentifullie and exactly: that he left to himſelf here no colour for this poore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe which he cometh in withall, of handling theſe queſtions poſitiuely. well, if the maiſter of the worke himſelf ſurveying it better ouer vpon my aduertiſment, do thinke his former arguments and anſweres, (which then he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke to bee compleate and inſoluble) to bee both ſlender and feeble: I make no doubt but that the diſcreet reader will doe him ſo much honor and credit, as to follow his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therin, and to eſteeme no better of them, then hee himſelf doth, that fauoureth them moſt, and should know them beſt. ſurelie mee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes it muſt needes be a ſufficient wrning to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man to beware how hee beleeueth him, who doth not beleeue himſelf in his former writings. Now to that bigge bragge of his, that hee hath in a brief advertiſment trowne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee terribly, &amp; like a Saturnian frowning angrie ſcholemaiſter ſcourged me according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: God bee thanked, his words be but wind. for the poore ſcholler ſo piteouſly whipped by him, feeles no paine at all. But what meant hee to hide that Cholericke pamphlet of his (written in more haſt belike, then good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de) in ſuch a corner, that a man muſt ride to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2473:40"/> the latter end of the third part of his long te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious bookes, ere he can find it out? well ſith it hath pleaſed him to range it in that place ſo farr out of the waie, he cannot bee offended that I do not anſwere it, till I come thither. in the meane ſeaſon let the iudicious reader, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a ſcantling by this my anſwere vnto his worke of longer meditation, how eaſilie that short pamphlett, written both in haſt and in paſſion, maie bee anſwered.</p>

Abbot pretends to be moſt pertinent to his purpoſe. To wit, the firſt, that Saint Paule both in his Epiſtle to the Romanes, and in the reſt, doth teach moſt branches of the Romane doctrine. which is handled from the page of my booke 134. vnto 149. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that ſo did alſo ſome of the moſt holie &amp; beſt learned ancient Bishops of Rome; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> p. 149. vnto p. 219. And as plainly againſt the third point, I declared that not ſo much as one here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned of old, is by the moderne church
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2473:41"/> of Rome reviued or countenanced: but that the proteſtants do in expreſſe tearmes revive, boulſter out, and vphold manie old rotten er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and hereſies, recorded and condemned for ſuch by the moſt ſound, ſincere and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſe witneſſes of the primitiue church; S. Auguſtin, Sainct Ambroſe, Sainct Hierome S. Epiphanius, and others; ſee the page 251. and manie after. all which being to bee found moſt certain and true, with a wett finger (as they ſaie) by turning onlie to the places quoted; the reader if he haue any care to find out the truth, and to avoid errors, will (I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe) take notice at the length of M. Abbots moſt palpable and notorious leaſings, who would make him beleeve that there were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing of ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in my booke of anie of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe matters.</p>

                  <p>YOV may here diſcouer why M. Abbot was bold to ſtraine a point, and to ſaie that I only touched the name Catholike, and that compariſon: that hee (forſooth) addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an anſwere thervnto, might be taken to haue, if not proceeded orderly, yet to haue ſpoken to the purpoſe directly. But it being euident and cleare, that I handled as well tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe other three pointes, and in the ſame order, as he propounded them: everie vnderſtanding man may perceaue, that his purpoſe was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shift from orderly proceeding, and to thruſt out ſome ſuch ſtuffe as he had ready for the preſent, to entertaine his favorable reader, and for the reſt to take a longer daie. wheras he ſaies, that he hath followed me ſtep by ſtep, he should rather haue ſaid leape by leap: and that with ſuch vnexpected nimble dexteritie in a man of his declining age, and heauy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: that at the verie firſt feeſe, he hath overlept fowerſcore and ſeauen pages of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; ſmoothing the matter ouer, as though all that had been vagaries, &amp; volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie diſcourſes of mine owne: when as in deed there is not one paſſage of them, but in anſwere to another of his, there alſo ſet downe, as everie one maie ſee. And that the reader maie take a vieu of his ſubſtantiall anſwering my booke, maie it pleaſe him to conſider, that in my whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke there are but two hundred, foureſcore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2473:42"/> and ſix pages in quarto. vnto threeſcore and one wherof, M. Abbots anſwere doth extend onelie: he beginning at the 87. and ending at the 148. and yet hath he chopped of by the waie 7 pages at one blowe, as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſesh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the 227. page of his booke: ſo that in all, he hath anſwered vnto 54 ſides, that is 27 lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in quarto: which doth not amonut to 7 sheetes of paper. Now out of theſe 7 sheets, you muſt alſo draw M. Abbots owne text which is compriſed within mine, and taketh vp neere hand the third part therof; ſo that in true reckoning his prettie thick booke in quarto, is but an anſwere to little more then fower sheets of mine; And yet the vanitie of this braggadochio is ſuch, that he would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke his ſimple reader beleeue, that he hath courſed me Iolily, following me ſtep by ſtep, and leaving nothing of ſubſtance in all my book vnanſwered.</p>

                  <p>OF this worke I haue finished but one only part, wherin I haue at large diſcouered their vaine oſtentation of the Catholike name and faith, and shewed plainelie, that the Romish religion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not with Saint Pauls Epiſtle to the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; nor with his other Epiſtles which M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shrop Calleth to aſſiſt him: bicauſe he findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to helpe him in that Epiſtle to the Romanes.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2473:42"/> In all which I have been carefull (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to giue thee ſatisfaction by the Cleere teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, either of ſome learned Bishop of Rome, or by ſome other famouſlie approued and comended by that church. Being now required a ſervice of another kind, ſo that I cannot yet goe forward with the reſt: I haue thought good to publish this in the meane time. If I haue promiſed anie thing in this, that is not here performed, expect it in that that is to come.

                  <p>BEcauſe I haue (as I hope) ſufficientlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied in my former booke, the mans vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne humor in preſuming aboue meaſure v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his owne ſtrength, and shewed that his vaunting words do farr ſurpaſſe his ſlender works: Therfore I do now onlie deſiret the reader to ſuſpend his Iudgment, till he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to behold the combat it ſelf. which I truſt to obtaine the ſooner, becauſe M.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2473:43"/> carrier) ſome more worthie peece of worke for a ſupplie. I am glad to ſee ſome more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie in the man then was wont to bee. we haue not now as he fondly vaunted in his firſt book, the whole truth furnished and ſet out with all its ſtrength, and ſuch troupes and bands levied, as should fright and put to flight all the world: but one part of a poore peece of worke, wherin he doubteth alſo whether he hath performed ſo much as he promiſed. ſeing the world ſo amended and ſuch a towardly diſpoſition in him, my poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re praiers shall not be wanting that he may haue grace to ſee his wn weaknes, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand daily better and better the badnes of their cauſe, to feele more and more the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of mans wit, ſetting it ſelf againſt the might of Gods truth; and ſo by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to retire himſelf from the bolſtering out of that which he perceiueth not to be ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall and ſound: and begin at length to employ his talents to the honour of him, and in defence of his cauſe, that hath beſtowed them vpon him. In the meane ſeaſon goods ir, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon haue you to except againſt mee, for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the other Epiſtles of S. Paule, aſwell as that to the Romanes, in favor of the Roman religion? be not proofes taken out of anie of the other as pregnant and forcible, as if they were taken out of that? are they not all alike canonicall and of the ſame divine authoritie? you doe but dreame, when you imagine, that proofes taken out of that to the Romanes, be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2473:43"/> more proper then others, for confirmation of the Romain faith. should not the Romanes beleeve anie thing deliuered in the other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of S. Paule as firmelie, &amp; receiue it as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantlie, as if it had been written to themſelues? Againe, that Epiſtle was not penned by the Romans to declare their faith, but was by the Apoſtle addreſſed to them for their further inſtruction and conſolation. wherfore it can be no more properly called a profeſſion of their faith, then of anie other Chriſtians: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Chriſtian being as well bound to beleeue all written therin, as the Romanes.</p>
                  <p>M. Abbot contrarie to his owne knowledg &amp; eie-ſight, doth ſaie that I craved aide of the other Epiſtles of S. Paul, becauſe I could find nothing to helpe mee, in that to the Romanes. for I do alleage many texts out of that verie Epiſtle, in proofe of the Catholike cauſe. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee reader but to turne to the 135. page of my booke, and if he there do not find, that I haue emploied as manie ſentences therof to mainteine our cauſe, as M.

But what if that bee not ſo neither? doth he not by heaping one falſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in the neck of another, much haſten on the downfall of his reputation and creditt? who is ignorant that the Roman church hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by name Cornelius Agrippas book <hi>de vanitate ſcientiarum?</hi> and yet M. Abbot page 851 doth ſolemnly cite him, for one of his grave Authors. All the learned know that the church of Rome doth not greatlie approue Eraſmus cenſures and annotations vpon S. Hieromes, and other Doctors workes. yet is he one of M. Abbots alleaged Authors page 72, Now for watſons Quodlibets, Ania<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus fables, and other ſuch like puddles, out of which M. Abbot takes ſome dreggs, to giue his gentle reader, ſatisfaction shall I ſaie, or rather infection? I ſay no more, but that they muſt needes be very kind, favorable, yea foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and ſimple readers too, that will take ſuch baſe coyne for good payment. And M. Abbot therby is conuinced to bee no man of his word. for hauing promiſed nothing but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Authors famouſly approued by vs, he doth notwithſtanding produce manie writers of no eſtimation at all in our church.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue I briefly runne ouer all. M. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots preface, that the whole driſt of his boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke might bee diſcloſed, and that the vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall reader might withall take a taſt of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2473:44"/> manner of his dealing; which if it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt much of craking, shifting, and miſreporting, he maie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture what he is to expect of him in that which followeth. I haue ſtood here vpon the particulers, to shew the reader what aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I might take of his words, if I would do the like in his whole booke. But well weig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing how ſmall profitt the reader should rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe out of anie ſuch verball contention; I will vtterlie avoid it, and in as short and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous ſort as may bee, I will relate trulie the ſence and ſubſtance of what M. Abbot ſaith, and ther vnto frame my anſwere. That the good reader may leeſe no time, but with eaſe and ſpeede, trace out and find where the truth reſteth. God grant him grace to embrace and follow it, and in his praiers to recommend vnto the father of light (from whom all good giftes do deſcend) my poore endeuors, that through his heavenlie bleſſing, they may yeeld that fruite which I deſire. And that both they and I, may ſerve his divine maieſtie faithfully all the daies of this life, and finallie through his infinite mercie obtayne life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Amen.</p>

But to put the cenſure of his triumph to his adverſaries conſcience, ſeemeth to exceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue an amplification. for hee was cock ſure to be condemned by me, for ſinging a triumph before the victorie, that before had told him plainely inough, that I ſcarſe found anie wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtie point in his booke worth the anſwering: and that there was better proofe of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in two leaues of M.

                     <p>I in the Epiſtle Dedicatory of my firſt boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke aganiſt M. Perkins, humblie. beſought his Maieſtie that he would bee pleaſed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that true Catholike and Apoſtolike faith, in which his moſt royall progenitors liued and died, whervnto M. Abbot anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that my petition was needles; bicauſe his Maieſtie had already embraced the ſame true, Catholike, and Apoſtolike faith. which to prove he made as it were this argument. <hi>The Catholike church is that which is ſpred over all the world, but the Roman church is not spred over all the world, therfore the Roman church is not the Catholike church.</hi> To which I replied, that granting the maior or firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to bee true; the minor or ſecond was not ſo direct to his purpoſe, as if he- should haue ſubſumed: <hi>but the English church,</hi> (the faith wherof his Maieſtie embraceth) <hi>is ſpred over all the world.</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>the English church is a true member of that church, which is ſpred over all the world;</hi> for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2473:47"/> whether the church of Rome bee the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church or no, the faith which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie embraceth cannot bee Catholike, vnles it bee that which either hath been, or now is ſpred ouer all the world. therfore no man can deny, but that it had been a more direct and ſpeedie courſe, to have proved their owne church to bee Catholike, then to goe about to diſprove the church of Rome to bee Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. for let vs ſuppoſe that which M. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot would have, (though it bee moſt vntrue) that the church of Rome were not the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church; Doth it thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> follow, that the church of England is Catholike? nothing leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. for there have been and are manie erring &amp; no Catholike congregations by the conſent of all men, different and diſſenting from the church of Rome. as for example were of old the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts, Macedonians.</hi> and att this time bee, the <hi>Trinitarians, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and ſuch like. ſuppoſing then the church of Rome not to bee Catholike, and that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish church doth not agree with the ſaid church; may it not nevertheleſſe bee ſome other erronious congregation, that is fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It muſt needes then follow, that M. Abbot beginning with the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, neither tooke a ſpeedie and direct, nor yet a ſure courſe, to prove his maieſties faith to bee Catholike. M. Abbot in his owne excuſe ſaith: <hi>that to prove his maieſties faith to bee Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2473:47"/> he muſt needes declare what the Catholike church was: bicauſe of the Catholike church it is, that the faith is called the Catholike faith.</hi> This I admitt for good doctrine, and do deſire the Reader to beare it well in mind: that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith muſt needes bee ſought for in the Catholike church, and cannot be found out, before wee haue the Catholike church to teach it vs. becauſe as M. Abbot affirmeth he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere, <hi>of the Catholike church it is, that the faith is called the Catholike faith.</hi> well go on good Sir, I grant that you did well to declare what was the Catholike faith, and what was the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church too, But having declared what was the Catholike church and faith, why did you not go in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to proue your English faith that his maieſtie maintaineth; or your English church, which hee vpholdeth, to bee that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me true Catholick church? To ſaie that that ſtumbling blocke, to witt, <hi>that the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me was the Catholike church</hi>) was firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way, will not ſerve the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. for that was not neceſſary. when as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if it had been true, might haue been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by it ſelf, without any mention made of the church of Rome. And if your fingers itched to haue a fling at the church of Rome, would it not haue been more ſeemly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, firſt to haue confirmed your owne faith to bee Catholike, which you tooke in hand? then having layed that fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the faith of Rome was not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. wherfore (I did neither idly nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2473:48"/> (as you write) require ſo much att your hands. but verie prepoſterouſly do you proceede, and beyond all meaſure. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly: that having ſpoken ſomewhat to declare what the Catholike church was, and that the church of Rome was not that Catholike church, do afterwards run throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh ſeaven or eight queſtions more, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an end of your booke too, before you come to take one chapter to prove that your English church is the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch; or that your English faith, is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith. Is not this to forgett your ſelf in the higheſt degree that is poſſible? to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a treatiſe to prove his maieſties faith to bee Catholike, and to profeſſe in the beginning of it, that to find out the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, wee muſt firſt find out the Catholike church: which being ſoone fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und out, and agreed vpon; <hi>to bee that which is spredd over all the world:</hi> after wardes in all the enſuing diſcourſe, not to haue one chapter to prove the English church or faith, to bee ſpred all the world over. was not this vtterly to leeſe himſelf, and to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ave his reader as it were. in the middle of a maze? Pervſe gentle reader the contents of all the chapters of M. Abbots booke, which bee fowreteene in number, thou shalt not find one of them, ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove directly, the faith of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to have been dilated into all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the firſt is, that the church of Rome
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2473:48"/> doth vainely pretend to bee the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke church; the ſecond conſiſteth of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene the Papiſts and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts. the third is about the Papiſts abuſe of the name Catholike. the fourth, that the church before Chriſt, was a part of the Catholike church: and that the old and new teſtament do not differ in ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of faith. The fift, that religion cannot ſatly bee grounded vpon the example of fathers and forefathers. the ſixth, that the reaſons of popery are not vrgent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. The ſeventh, of the florishing and beſt ſtate of the church of Rome: and of the fulnes of doctrine contayned in Saint Pauls Epiſtle to the Romanes: of Idolatry in worſtipping of Saints. The eighth of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification before God. The ninth, of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before man. The tenth, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life cannot bee purchaſed by meritt. The eleaventh, the firſt motion of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is ſinne. The twelfth; that the ſpirit giues witnes to the faithfull, that they bee the ſonnes of God. The 13. that good workes are not meritorious of life to come The 14. that the Epiſtles of Saint Paul are looſely alleaged by the papiſts. lo here is the end of the booke and as a man may well ſaie, <hi>finis ante principium,</hi> a concluſion of the worke, before he begin to handle the principall point in queſtion. to witt, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hether that faith which his Maieſtie
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2473:49"/> embraceth, bee the Catholike faith. that is, whether at any time it hath been receiued in all Chriſtian countries. ſo that in one word this booke of M. Abbots may bee anſwered with a <hi>nihil dicit,</hi> as our com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>on lawiers tearme it, that is, hee hath ſaid iuſt nothing to that which hee vndertooke to performe therin. for having taken in hand to prove, that the faith of the English congregation is Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and conſequently that it hath been vniverſally planted in all nations: now to let that ſtand a cooling, and to argue that the church of Rome is not the Catholike church, but rather Donaſticall: and that it abuſeth the name Catholike: that the church in old father Abrahams daies, was a part of the Catholike church; and ſuch other impertinent queſtions: was it not rather (as one maie ſay) to lead a wild Gooſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and to wander vp and downe very ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelie, then to ſpeake to the point of the queſtion propounded? And albeit it draw ſome what neerer the matter to go about to proue the Proteſtants doctrine, to be more conformable vnto the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the doctrine of the Catholiks: yet that is a ſeverall diſtinct queſtion, and to bee handled after another manner. for I doe in one chapter ioyne Iſſue with M. Abbot therin, and doubt not to make it good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt anie proteſtant, that the Catholike Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faith is much more ſutable even vnto
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2473:49"/> the verie true text of tke Bible, then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: and that by conference of our doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne word by word, and ſentence by ſentence, with the verie words and ſentences of holy writt. But to prove our faith to bee Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke wee take another courſe, and do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that the chief prelates and Doctors of the Catholike church, who have florished in moſt Chriſtian countries ſince the Apoſtles time, have taught the verie ſame doctrine which wee teach, and maintained the ſame faith, and ſerved God with the ſame Religion, that we do. which M. Abbot muſt performe for their faith and religion, if hee will haue any wiſe men beleeue them to bee Catholiks: even by his owne explication of the name Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike; in his anſwer to my Epiſtle; and by his owne confeſſion heere, when hee faith; <hi>that wee cannot find out the Catholike faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee have found out the Catholike church; of which the faith is named Catholike.</hi> Now no man can find out the Catholike church, but by tracing out that companie of the faithfull who have peopled all Chriſtian nations. w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich M. Abbot not being able to do for the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes faith, doth returne the ſame queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mee: and would haue mee to do the ſame for our doctrine, and namely, for that point of the popes power to depoſe Princes: <hi>which</hi> (as hee ſaies) <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine doth hold to be one of the chief points of our faith,</hi>

I will bring him in more authentik evidence for this iſſue then would be the hands and ſeales of the moderne churches of <hi>Grecia, Armenia, Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, Ruſſia,</hi> and ſuch like ſchiſmaticall and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring congregations, (which M. Abbot here demaundeth) as the reader shall ſee in the next paragraffe or diviſion, where that queſtion of the ſupremacy, shalbe treated of. But honeſt ſir, why do you by the way ſo wound your credit in miſalleadging that moſt learned Cardinals wordes? doth he in the place by you quoted ſaie, <hi>that the ſupremacly of the pope, for the depoſing of kings, is one of the chief points of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith?</hi> will no warning ſerve the turne, to make you cite your authors ſincerely? if this bee the shuffling wherin your beſt skill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, the reader in deed hath great need to looke well to your fingers; Card. Bellarmine, both there and elſwhere doth teach, that the popes ſupremacy is one of the principalle heads of our religion. But hee doth not affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me there, that the popes power to depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe princes, is any chief article of our faith.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2473:50"/> though hee taught that to bee a moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, and in ſome ſort to appertaine to the ſupremacie, as a dependant thervpon. Now to that which followeth out of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of Card. Bellarmin; <hi>hee</hi> (you ſaie) <hi>shall free vs from need to travell for this proofe (to wit that our English faith hath been ſpred all the world over) who ſaith, that though one only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince did retaine the true faith, yet the ſame might properly bee called the Catholike church (and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faith the Catholike faith) ſo long as it could bee cleerly shewed, that the ſame is one and the ſame, with that, which at anie time was ſpred over the whole world.</hi> whervpon M. Abbot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that to prove their faith to bee the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, it wilbee ſufficient to prove, that is was that which once was ſpred over all the world. Now with the proofe therof M. Bishop (ſaith hee) is chooked already. Behold the babling of this vaine man. firſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall doth not eaſe him anie whitt at all, from proving their faith to have been ſpred over all the world: but only ſaith vpon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (<hi>Si ſola vna provincia retineret veram fidem,</hi> if one onlie province kept the true faith) that then it might bee called Catholike: yet ſo, that it could bee cleerlie shewed, to haue been ſpred in times paſt, over all the world. where you ſee, that hee requires of neceſſitie, that it muſt bee cleerly shewed, that the ſame faith which wilbee accounted Catholike, hath been before at leſt ſpredd over all the world. ſo that M. Abbot is as farr to ſeeke as hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2473:51"/> and that hee muſt needes come to this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, how vnwilling ſoever hee bee, and either shew that their faith hath been receiued all Chriſtendome over, or els confeſſe that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee called Catholike. Come of then gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Sir, flie not from the point, ſeek not to hide your head in a corner, but performe that peece of ſervice bravely, and then hardlie talke of chooking M. Bishop. but to avouch that M. Bishop is chooked already, long before anie proof thereof be brought, with onlie hearing you to ſpeake of it, is too too childish, and full of doting vanitie.</p>
                     <p>I found fault with M.

And if you will needs leave that which you profeſſed to purſue in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2473:52"/> the ſuddes for a ſeaſon, and fall vpon the church of Rome; do not ſtand triffling vpon tearmes and titles, like an idle Caviller: but as it beſeemes a Doctor of the chaire, prove ſoundly if you can that the now church of Rome, doth not beleeve and profeſſe all points of the Catholike faith. whether the church of Rome, may bee called abſolutlie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church or no, or in what ſence it is ſo called, are other by queſtions, ſcarſe incident, at leaſt nothing neceſſarie, to that wee have now in hand. for whether the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me bee ſtiled the Catholike church or no, ſo that it hold entirely the true Catholike faith, then maie his maieſtie lawfully and laudably, receiue and defend the whole doctrine of the ſaid church: and to obtaine ſaluation, muſt make himſelf a member therof. which was all that I humblie craved of his moſt excellent Maieſtie. The iſſue then of this preſent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and the marke that M. Abbot should levell att, is to shew, that his maieſtie embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the faith of the church of Rome, should not embrace the true Catholike faith. if hee do not effect this, hee doth nothing. if leaving his iſſue, hee fall to plucking of vizards (as hee to excuſe his vnſeaſonable digreſſion doth w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite) from I know not whoſe faces, (as though he going about this matter, had mett by the waie, with ſome maske or mummery) may he not well bee reſembled to a boy that ſent on an errant falleth to blowing of feathers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wind will carrie them, and lets his

Ergo the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church is not the Catholike church.</hi> Againe to the ſame effect, <hi>No part can bee the whole; but the Roman church is a part of the Catholike church. therfore it cannot bee the whole Catholike church.</hi> Theſe be his arguments reviewed, and put into the beſt frame that maie bee, to avoide all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the forme. As I do verie willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie alſo let paſſe his moſt idle bables of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams and Anianus Aſſes, and his ſcarſe ſweet poem of horſe balles ſinging in the poole. <hi>Nos poma natamus:</hi> bicauſe ſuch ſcurrility becomes not divines, yea is ſcarſe tollerable in any ſort of ciuil men: to the Arguments then thus I anſwere.</p>
                  <p>If the concluſion were granted to M.

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:2473:53"/> which is ſoe apparant, that M.

Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot hath raked together againſt the church of Rome in fower paragraffes of this chapter, I will more particularly and fully diſſolue them.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then firſt, the argument is miſtaken, and doth not conclude that which is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. the queſtion is not, whether the Roman church bee the Catholike church in vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall: but whether the Roman church maie bee called the Catholike church, or rather whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it maie bee couched togither in ſtile with the Catholike church. M. Abbot ſaith no, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe bee his words. <hi>For the pulling of this vizard from their faces, I noted the abſurditie that is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in that ſtile, of the Catholike Roman church: for the Catholike church</hi> (I ſaie) <hi>is the vniverſall church, the Roman church is a particular church, therfore to ſaie the Catholike Roman church, is all one as to ſaie, the vniuerſall particuler church.</hi> This was M. Abbots firſt argument; and the drift of it was to diſprove that ſtile of ours, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Roman church.</hi> Now in his latter refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med argument, hee is come to change the tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and in ſtead of that, the particular Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church, cannot bee ſaid, called or ſtiled, the Catholike church: doth bring in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the Roman church is not the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church: wherin lieth a great fallacy; for

I anſwere that it often fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, that one thing is called by the name of another thing, though it bee not fully out the ſame. for example, ſome part maie bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of whole, though it bee not the whole, as a part of the aire, is called the ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: anie part of the water, is called water. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which if a man should reaſon as M. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot doth, no part is the whole, but this is a part of water, therfore it is not the whole; the concluſion might bee graunted him, and yet had hee gotten nothing therby, but the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of miſarguing, and not concluding that which was in queſtion; the queſtion being, whether a part might bee called by the name of the whole, which hee toucheth not: and not whether it were the whole or noe, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee diſputeth. it fareth even ſo in the former argument. for the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being whether with the Catholike church, might bee linked in the ſame ſtile, the church of Rome; hee concludes onlie that the church of Rome is not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2473:54"/> church: which if wee grant him, he were never the nearer: for albeit the church of Rome were not the Catholike church ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vniuerſo, or abſolutely: yet may it be called by the name of the whole, and much more, be in ſtile linked with the whole. firſt, bicauſe everie particular church (that keepeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of faith and religion with the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Catholike church) may bee called and tearmed the Catholike church. which M.

Thirdly, for that wee beleeve (as euery good Chriſtian ought to do, which in this ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal bepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) the Roman church to bee the chief, and as it were the head of the vniuerſall church,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2473:55"/> and therfore the Roman maie rather in ſtile bee coopled with the vniverſall Catholike then anie other. This then is the firſt fault and that a very foule one. which M. Abbot doth committ in this argument, he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that which is in queſtion, but flitteth away from it and quite changeth the tearmes. wherefore having altered it he doth ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly, that hee hath reduced it into moode and figure; which if he would haue done rightly, thus hee should have framed his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>No particuler church can bee ioyned in ſtile with the Catholike church, or can bee called the Catholike church; but the Roman church is a particuler church: Ergo, it cannot bee ioyned in ſtile or called the Catholike church.</hi> If it had been thus reduced into moode and figure, as true ſcholaſticall, and plaine dealing required, it had not had in it anie one good propoſition. I haue proved already that the maior is falſe, becauſe anie particuler church (ſound in faith and religion) may bee called the Catholike church, and ioyned in ſtile with the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: even as well and as truly, as any part of the aire, may bee called the aire. And more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the churh of Rome, for the priviledges it hath of continuing alwaies in the true faith; and for her ſuperiority in governement. The minor alſo or ſecond propoſition is not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true. for albeit that church of Rome, that is conteyned within the walls and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Rome, bee a particuler church: yet the church of Rome in a larger ſignification, maie
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2473:55"/> bee taken for the whole Catholike church, and deſigne aſwell the true church of fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, of England, or anie other nation, as that of Italy. which I will demonſtrate in the next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraff. wherfore the minor propoſition (w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is, <hi>but the church of Rome, is a particuler church</hi>) is not abſolutely true: bicauſe it may aſwell bee taken for the vniverſall, as for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler church. both the premiſſes then and former propoſitions, being ſubiect to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, the concluſion muſt needes bee ſtarke naught. Briefly in that argument wherof the Proteſtants do make ſuch account, there bee three foule faults. Two bee in it, as they frame it: the firſt, in that it miſtaketh or changeth the tearmes, and in ſteed of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church, not to bee called or ſtiled the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, they conclude, that it is not the Catholike. The ſecond, in that they take for granted, that the Roman church is onlie a particuler church, when as it may and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taken for the vniverſall. The third fault, will shew it ſelf in the firſt propoſition when the argument comes to bee rightly framed thus. <hi>No particuler church can be called or ſtiled the Catholike church:</hi> which is moſt falſe. bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe every true particuler church may bee called the Catholike church or ſtiled with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</p>
                  <p>M. Abbots ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d argument being not much vnlike the firſt may in like manner bee defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet more shalbee ſaid of it in the fourth paragraff.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nowe to make good the reaſons that I have given, why the church of Rome may bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſpeciallie linked with the Catholike in ſtile, namely, for her ſuperiority in governement; this preſent paragraff muſt bee employed. w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here M. Abbot doth what hee can, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the ſame. in the next ſection it shalbee proued that the Roman church may well ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie the whole Catholike church. in the laſt ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this chapter, wee shall ſpeake a word or two of M. Abbots later argument.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ſupremacie of the church of Rome, M. Abbot acknowledgeth to belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnto that church as it then was, eminency of place, precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of honour, authoritie of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but no authoritie of power, or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in government, over any of the reſt. w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich to make good, hee inſtituteth a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly diſcourſe, now carping at that which I ſaid before, in defence of that ſuperioritie of government: then powring forth many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confuſedly, ſome heere, ſome there, to diſprove the ſame: ſo that, I can ſcarſe deviſe how to range them in anie good order. yet to make the matter as ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible and perſpicuous, as his perplexed proceeding will give mee leave: I will gather into the firſt place what hee hath ſcatteringly diſputed againſt the ſupremacy of the church of Rome, and giue anſwere to that. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly I will confirme our part. Laſtly, I will examine how ſufficientlie hee hath anſwered my former argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, made to prove the ſame. M. Abbots firſt argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt the primacye of the ſea of Rome, is taken <hi>ab authoritate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:2473:56"/> as ſchollers do vſe to ſpeake, from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie negatiuelie. which kind of reaſoning, though among the proteſtants it bee holden for currant in matter of faith: yet hee can not be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that wee allow not of it; who hold ſome points of faith to bee deliuered by vnw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritten tradition: wherfore if hee had not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iudgment, hee should not ſo confidentlie haue vſed ſuch kind of arguments againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>But let vs heare them ſuch as they be. <hi>S. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Peter and S. Paul, do make no mention of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie of the churh of Rome in their Epiſtles, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is none ſuch:</hi> this is a verie vaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient argument, even in the waie of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. for albeit they would grant, that if the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re were no warrant for it in all the old or new teſtament, that then it were not to bee credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yet they would not denie, but that it might bee a matter of faith, though there were no mention made of it in S. Peter, or S. Pauls Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſo that it bee recorded in anie other part of the ſcriptures: for all parts of the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are alike true: wherfore anie thing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in anie parcell therof, is as well to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, as if it were written in S. Peters or S. Pauls Epiſtles. <hi>But M. Abbot vrgeth in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: S. Paul writ an Epiſtle to the Romanes, and therfore hee would not haue omitted that their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, if any ſuch had been.</hi> I anſwere that S. Paul writt to the Romans not of all matters, but to inſtruct them in ſome importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of doctrine, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort them in their tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: which hee might well do, without maki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g any mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the priviledges of their church.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2473:57"/> beſides neither M. Abbot not anie man els (I thinke) is able to shewe, that S. Paul in all that Epiſtle doth ſo much as once treat of Bishops, or church government: wherfore he had no occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miniſtred to talke of the Roman chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſupremacy. Let it for this time ſuffice, that S. Paul doth els where acknowledg S.

                  <p>By the record of all theſe ancient fathers S. Paul went vp to Ieruſalem to viſit S.

Now to M. Abbots ſecond argument, which is yet worſe then the former. <hi>S. Iohn did honour to the ſeaven churches of Aſia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>writing to them;</hi> and yet hee <hi>would never speake of the ſeaven hills of Rome, but as of the ſeate of the whore of Babylon.</hi> Ergo what you pleaſe: a meſſe of plumme pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage if you will, for this pleaſant Ieſter, rather then diſputer. hath this ſophiſme ſo much as the shadow of a ſorie argument? S. Iohn in the 2. and 3. chapters of the reuelations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes no mention of the church of Romes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy: Ergo there is no ſuch matter in all the ſcripture. M. Abbot blushing at the vglie shape of this ilfavoured argument, to botch it out, doth adde: <hi>that by thoſe ſeaven churches, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re figured the whole church of Chriſt, and yet there is not a word in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſupremacie of the church of Rome.</hi> I thinke well, nor of thundreth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters moe that belonge to the chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. for theſe ſeaven short letters which S. Iohn writes to the ſeaven churches, are contained within the compaſſe of three pages of one little leafe in octauo, in their owne bible: and can anie man bee ſo ſimple as to dreame, that all the points of our faith are comprehended within them? S. Iohn com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ends the vertues, &amp;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2473:58"/> reprehends the vices of thoſe churches; but doth treat of verie few points of doctrine: and therfore no ſtrange caſe, if hee ſpake not of the ſupremacie of the church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>M. Abbots third argument, the church of Rome hath a ſpeciall caution given her, <hi>not to preſume vpon her ſtabilitie in the faith, leſt she fall.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.</note> 
                     <hi>S. Paul ſaying to her: Be not high minded but feare: for if God spared not the naturall branches, take heed alſo leſt hee ſpare not thee. Behold the bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of God towards thee, if thou continue in his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifulnes, or els alſo thou shalt bee cut of. Ergo w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat:</hi> hee had neede to bee a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning fletcher, that could make either a bolt or a shaft of this, fit for the purpoſe. Firſt, here is nothing at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the church of Romes ſupremacie, nor yet anie certaine aſſertion againſt her ſtability in the received faith. For here is aſwell a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Gods bountifulnes towards them, if they will do well: as a threat againſt them, if they do evill. Againe, all this is beſides the cushion: for though that Epiſtle bee to the Romanes, yet S. Paul there doth expreſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that diſcourſe not to the Romanes in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler, but in generall to all the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it thus: <hi>for to you Gentils I ſay, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. v. <hi>13</hi>
                     </note> and goes on with a compariſon betweene the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and the Gentils: ſo that nothing is more perſpicuous, then that the warning there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is not ſpeciall to the Romans, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all Gentiles.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> M. Abbot having given ſuch a mighty pus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he at our poſition, cometh to confute that I ſaid, to witt: that it is deduced out of Gods word rightly vnderſtood, according to the interpretation of the ancient fathers, that the church of Rome, is that rock vpon which Chriſt built his church, againſt which the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of hell shall never prevaile. To which M. Abbot as though he went about to choke dawes, ſaies; <hi>that I giue him chalke for cheeſe; bicauſe I promiſed a deduction out of the word of God, and in ſteed therof, bring an expoſition of the ancient fathers.</hi> Marke gentle reader my words, and then thou canſt not but find M. Abbot to be an egregious wrangler. for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that deduction which I promiſed out of Gods word, naming the verie place out of which it is deduced. but becauſe I ioyned with it, (according vnto the expoſition of ancient fathers) hee like a man ſcarſe well in his wits cries out, that in ſteed of ſcriptures I bring in an expoſition of the fathers. when I do make mention of the fathers expoſition, not as the ground of my deduction, but onlie for the true ſenſe of thoſe words of holy ſcripture, out of which I do make the ſaid collection.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2473:59"/> The deduction in my former booke was verie briefe, bicauſe I did there point onlie at the places of holie ſcriptures, out of which it might bee gathered; the queſtion of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy being there but touched by the way. wherof M. Abbot takes advantage and ſaies, that I am dumbe, and can ſay no more: becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe I will not bee like to him, and out of ſeaſon thruſt forth long diſcourſes of by queſtions. I hauing alſo before written a whole chapter of the ſupremacy, in my ſecond part againſt M. Perkins: where M. Abbot ſaw well enough, that I could haue ſaid here much more of the ſame matter if need had ſo required. but ſuch is his impudencie, that he cares not what hee ſaie, ſo hee maie make a shewe to his ſimple reader, that hee hath canvaſed his aduerſarie. ſeeing that M. Abbot hath here hudled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verie much of that matter, I will more at large ſett downe theſe deductions, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie confirme each member therof. The firſt fountaine out of which all the reſt do flow as riuers, is this. <hi>The chief ſuperiority in governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and authoritie of power over all the church, was by our bleſſed Saviour given to S. Peter, and to his ſucceſſors vnto the end of the world: but the Bishops of Rome, are S. Peters ſucceſſors: therfore the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of Rome have from our ſaviours grant and gift authority of power, and ſuperiority of goverment over all the church.</hi> The maior of this argument is to bee deduced out of the word of God. the minor being a matter of fact, and that which hapned after S. Peters death, to wit, <hi>who was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2473:60"/> his ſucceſſor:</hi> shall haue ſound proofe out of the moſt approved teſtimony, of the beſt witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſince that age. All which being performed, the concluſion, that the Bishop of Rome hath ſupreme commaunding power over all the church, muſt needs ſtand moſt aſſured. That our bleſſed ſaviour gaue ſuperiority of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment to S. Peter, vnder the metaphore of a rocke or foundation in building when he ſaid, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 16</note> 
                     <hi>and vpon this rocke I will build my church;</hi> Thus I proue. Chriſt made Peter the rock or foundation of his church: therfore he gaue to him the chiefeſt place of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it. for as the foundation is firſt placed and doth vphold all the reſt of the building: ſo he that is the foundation in the ſpirituall buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſtes church, hath the chiefeſt place therin, &amp; is to com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>and over all the reſt. To make this more perſpicuous, we muſt call to mind, that amongeſt other titles and names of the church of God, one is <hi>a houſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle sheweth: <hi>that thou maiſt knowe how to converſe in the houſe of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2473:60"/> vpon a firme rock, builded his church: which is as much to ſay, as that hee gave him firme and infallible authoritie, vpon which all the faithfull should rely, for finall reſolution, in all doubts of faith, religion, and manners, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich do neceſſarily appartayne to the edifying of Chriſts church. this may ſerue for a curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expoſition of the firſt fountaine of holy ſcripture, out of which I derived that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour beſtowed vpon S. Peter the ſupreme place of government in his church: a fuller confirmation of it shall follow by and by.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 I might add for further proof of the ſame poſition out of Saint Iohns Goſpell, how our bleſſed Lord ſevering Saint Peter from the reſt of the Apoſtles, and intimating how S. Peter loved him more then anie of them; gave to him as head paſtor, the charge of both his sheepe and lambes, that is, of all Chriſtians, aſwell the cleargy as the laity, to bee by him inſtructed, ruled and governed, as the flock of sheepe is fed and ruled by the shepheard, which according to the ancient doctors teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, doth verie plainly confirme Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſupremacie, as you shall heare preſently out of their own wordes. yet this, though it bee moſt pregnant among the reſt, I then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: becauſe the queſtion of the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was not to bee handled there at the full. I touched alſo a third text to prove that the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Rome, as Saint Peters ſucceſſor, should never faile in confirming of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the true faith; taken out of Saint
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2473:61"/> Luke. where our Lord ſaith. <hi>Simon, Simon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>

                     <hi>sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath required to haue you for to ſifte as w<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heate; but I haue praied for thee, that thy faith faile not; and thou once converted, confirme thy brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> wher vpon it followeth that all others ought to repaire to him and his ſucceſſors for reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all controverſies in faith, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by him; and are bound therby to obey him as the perſon, to whom Chriſt gaue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to confirme his brethren. Of the firſt text of ſcripture shalbee treated more at large in this ſection; for the others I will onlie note ſome places of the holy fathers, where the reader maie ſee the very ſame explication of Chriſtes words and deduction that I make he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by their auctoritie approved: bicauſe M. Abbot doth here verie hotly call for ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, and ſeemeth ſo earneſtly ſett vpon the ſight of them, that I muſt needes giue him out of hand, at leaſt the quotations of them in the margent, and then (ſmall doubt) but hee will preſently bee ſatisfied, if there bee ſuch honeſtie in him, as hee makes shew of, well, if it bee no more then for the good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders content, I will giue him more then hee demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that is not only the quotations in the margent, but their words alſo in the text.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2473:72"/> to him, and to his ſucceſſors the Bishops of Rome. purity of faith, boldnes of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, fervour of Charitie (rare gifts of God beſtowed on S.

                  <p>After theſe arguments M.

                  <p>I anſwer that he should rather haue made this inference: bicauſe Chriſt is the rocke of the Church moſt properly: therfore S.

To ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Saint Peter to bee called a rocke, becauſe hee is a patterne of imitation, is as dull and blockish, as to call a duske darke ſtone, a cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere looking glaſſe.

Before you heard that no other bodie ſaving Chriſt alone, could bee that rock; and to make that good M.

And all this to make men beleeve, that it is but an ordinary matter to bee that rocke, vpon which Chriſt built his Church. wee that hold it to bee one of the greateſt priviledges that could bee gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a mortall man, do notwithſtanding graunt, that the Apoſtles may be called rockes as they are called foundations, after a certaine proportion; that is, as S. Peter was the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall rock, placed next vnto our Saviour over the whole Church: So the Apoſtles we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re conſtituted principall pillers or rockes of certaine countries, laying the foundation of Chriſtian religion in them, by preaching the Goſpell, and by ruling the ſeverall flockes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charges. As Metropolitans &amp; primates may bee ſaid to bee the rockes and foundations of Chriſtian religion in their provinces, bicauſe they do principally commaund over all Eccleſiaſticall perſons therin; and do keepe all vnder them in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2473:73"/> vnitie of faith; In like manner to preſerve all Chriſtian countries in the ſaid vnitie of faith and vniformitie of religion; there ought to bee one ſupreme paſtor over all the world; who firſt was S. Peter, and ever ſince have been his lawfull Succeſſors, the Bishops of Rome. All this is good doctrine, but to ſaie that theſe words in S. Mathew. were ſpoken aſwell to the reſt of the Apoſtles as to S. Peter, which M. Abbot would faine haue his reader believe, is flatt againſt the evidence of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie text. For S. Peter is there ſevered from the reſt by all circumſtances that can bee deviſed in ſo few words. firſt by his owne proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: for our Saviour ſaid to him, <hi>happie art thou Simon.</hi> then by the name of his father: <hi>the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Ionas.</hi> thirdly by mention of a ſpeciall revelation made to him: <hi>for flesh and blood hath not revealed this to thee.</hi> fourthly by expreſſe direction of this ſpeech to him: <hi>I ſay to thee,</hi> (not to all the Apoſtles) <hi>thou art Peter;</hi> none of the reſt were ſo called. Out of which it doth enſue moſt cleerly, that the words immediatly following <hi>(and vpon this rocke I will build my church)</hi> were particulerly ſpoken to S. Peter, and not to any other of the Apoſtles. To the others afterward was given the power of binding and looſing, remitting of ſins and retayning: yet with out any mention made of the keies of the kingdome of heaven: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich albeit they do ſignify there a ſupreme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I did affirme that it might bee deduced out of the ancient fathers, that the Bishop or ſea of Rome, was that rocke vpon which the church was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. M.

                  <p>This kind of letters was in great vſe in the primitiue church; for no ſtranger was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into communion among the Catholiks without them. The invention of theſe leters is referred to the firſt generall councell hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Nice: and the forme of them, is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded authentically in the end of the Chalcedon councell (immediatlie before the letters of the Illuſtrious perſons that wrote in or about that councell) vnder this title. <hi>Atticus Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, qualiter formata Epiſtola fiat.</hi> In this epiſtle, fower letters principally were ſet for an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red token, that hee in whoſe favour they were granted, was a ſound Catholike.

                  <p>This is a verie poore obiection: for ſpeaking (as wee now do) of the church, which was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce our Saviours time; if hee take that ſeaſon next to Chriſts aſcenſion; S.

                  <p>Another like ſlugg M.

And by name that one was S. Peter for his life time. All which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue before proved out of holy ſcriptures, and the ancient fathers. S. Peter finally making choiſe of Rome for the ſeat of his Bishoprick, liued there many yeres, and in the end, died Bishop of Rome. wherfore they that were chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bishops of Rome, were to ſuccede him, as in that ſeate, ſo in that ſupreme governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſts church: which daily experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs. for wee ſee that whoſoever is choſen bishop of any place, for example of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie;

And albeit they may comitt ſome fault, vnworthy their calling, yet they do not therby leeſe the dignitie of their place. And that namely our Saviour had praied for S.

And laſtly, that our bleſſed Lord hath taken ſuch order for their ſure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others in the right waie: that though ſome traitor or evill man should creepe into that chaire, yet everie good Chriſtian maie for ever repoſe aſſured confidence in them. This being the auncient doctrine, and aſſured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of all good Chriſtians; M. Abbots ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le ieſt of the popes ſitting downe in a chaire when hee is to define a matter, is to bee laug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed at, as an idle and ignorant imagination.</p>
                  <p>It were indeed verie ſimple to thinke that the only ſitting downe of the pope in a chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, should bee a ſufficient helpe to define hard and doubtfull queſtions. But to define <hi>ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra,</hi> as it is tearmed, hath a farr other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among Catholike Doctors, which may bee thus declared. The pope as a learned Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne may, write manie large diſcourſes in matter of diuinitie, and make goodly commentaries vpon ſundrie bookes of holy ſcripture, as S. Leo, S. Gregorie, and diuers other of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue done: in which his workes, hee having no further aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate Doctour of the ſame learning and holines of life hath, may as a man miſtake ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methings, and bee deceiued. But when as chief paſtor of Chriſts church, hee comes to define any deepe queſtion for the inſtruction of the whole church; then hee hath (through the vertue of our bleſſed Saviours praier) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the holie ghoſt. Firſt to cauſe that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2473:90"/> matter to bee dulie ſifted and conſidered of by learned Divines, according to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and difficultie therof either by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only of his owne ordinarie councell in his courto of Rome, if the queſtion bee but ordinarie: or if it bee of greater conſequence, and do concerne a whole nation, or the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall church: then with the aid of a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or generall councell; And finally after ſuch mature aduiſe taken, to giue his ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and to determine it. this is that which wee meane, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen wee ſaie, that the popes holines can never erre, when hee comes for the information and inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church, to define anie doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full queſtion <hi>ex cathedra,</hi> that is, iudicially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due examination. the infallibility of which ſentence wee do not attribute to the learning, wiſdome, or godlines of the pope, and much leſſe to the ſitting downe in his chaire (as M. Abbot dreamed) who being a mortall man maie err and doe amiſſe: but vnto our Saviours provident foreſight, and vnto the moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red verity of his promiſe made to S. Peter, and his ſucceſſors; which prayer and promiſe of our bleſſed Saviour can neuer faile. Againſt the evidence of which truth M. Abbot having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſaie in reaſon, fals a railing at his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne miſconceit of it, and cals it a drunken mans dreame. which if hee himſelf will needs haue to bee ſo, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lett him to tearme his owne dreame as hee liſt. Manie men of a more ſober and adviſed ſpiritt can eaſilie vnderſtand, that there was verie great reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2473:91"/> (being to eſtablish an eccleſiaſticall ſtate, which hee would haue toſt and to the worlds end, incorrupt in Doctrine, &amp; vniforme in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie rites and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners) should eſtablish ſome one at the leaſt, to reſolue infallibly all the reſt in all doubtfull queſtions, that should ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, which he forſaw would be almoſt innumerable. And to endow him with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power and authority, to kepe all the reſt in order and due obedience. This is that w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich wee maintaine he did for S.

                  <p>Thus much to shew how vnſoundly M. Abbot interpreteth that text of holy ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and how vnproperly and feebly hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to shift from the moſt literall and vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me expoſition of the ancient Doctors.

Note firſt a moſt cleere proofe of that for which I cited it, to witt; that everie church, yea everie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, muſt not of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, but of neceſſitie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the church of Rome, in matter of faith and religion. Bicauſe in it as in a rich treaſurie, that doctrine which the Apoſtles taught, is kept whole and ſound. to which M. Abbot ſaith, that if wee take the reaſon added by Irenaeus, but concealed by mee, it will plainly appeare why it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2473:92"/> for the other churshes to accord with the church of Rome. <hi>for this church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the renowme of the place, being then the ſeat of the Empire, was the moſt eminent church of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwere that I concealed nothing. And this reaſon added by M. Abbot is wholie miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. for there is no mention in Irenaeus of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperors power or ſeate, for that mighty principality is proper to the church of Rome, for her ſpirituall dignitie. And it is moſt abſurd to thinke that the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in thoſe ancient daies of S. Irenaeus, (when the Emperours were moſt deadly ennemies of the Chriſtian name) gott any reputation with other churches, by the worldly renowme of thoſe perſecuting Emperors, who raigned there. for that their wicked glorie was rather a whetſtone to hatred and contempt, then anie allurement to loue and eſtimation.</p>
                  <p>This great reſpect then being borne vnto the church of Rome, before the Emperors of Rome were converted to be Chriſtians, is a moſt manifeſt argument that the principality of the church of Rome, was not gotten by the renowme of that city, nor by the glorie of theſe heathen peeſecuting Emperors: but for that the beſt learned, and moſt holie prelats of all countries, were taught by the Apoſtles and their ſchollers, that it was our bleſſed Saviours pleaſure and ordinance, that ſuch regard and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce should bee yeelded vnto the church of Rome: were the Emperors therof heathens
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2473:92"/> or Chriſtians, good or bad. It was in deed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie convenient, that the prince of the Apoſtles, and head of Chriſts church, should be there ſeated, where the Monarch of the temporall eſtate held his court: to the intent, that impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being there crushed as it were in the head, might the ſooner decaie all the bodie over: And true godlines being happely planted in the cheif place, might with more facility and ſpeed bee ſpred in all other nations; and alſo that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might bee more eaſily induced to yeeld religious obedience to the Bishop of that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, vnto whoſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall magiſtrates, the whole world before had obeied in temporall affaires. But this is to bee attibuted to our Saviours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdome, order, &amp; inſtitution: Not vnto the greatnes or worldlie pollicie of anie earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Emperors. M. Abbot ſeing little hold to bee taken vpon the renowme of that place, as the ſtate of things went then, <hi>doth acknowledg that in thoſe daies the church of Rome was pure &amp; ſound, &amp; therfore fitt to be propounded as a patterne for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches to imitate: But now the caſe is altered (as he ſaith) bicauſe the church of Rome it ſelf is now queſtioned, for ſwarving from the tradition of the Apoſtles: which being ſoe, that cannot be ſaid to bee neceſſarie now, which was neceſſarie then.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This anſwer hath as litle ſolidity in it as the other. For the church of Rome it ſelf, was as well chalenged in thoſe daies for ſwarving from the Apoſtles tradition, by the Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taniſts, Marcioniſts, and ſuch like Heretikes, as now by the Lutherans, Calviniſts and Anabaptiſts. And neuertheles the renowmed prelates of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2473:93"/> Chriſts church, and moſt firme pillers of our Chriſtian religion, did then teach all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to make their recourſe vnto the ſame church for reſolution of the true faith, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing them to conforme themſelues therto, and by avouching boldlie that doctrine, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich they found there maintained, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all them that taught the contrary, as yee haue heard out of Irenaeus. Let vs therfore as kind children treading in the right ſteps of thoſe our moſt laudable forfathers, ſeeke with them vnto that ſame church of Rome, for the veritie of that doctrine which deſcended from the Apoſtles, imbrace it moſt willingly, and profeſſe it as conſtantlie: though we heare our holie mother to be called into queſtion by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardlie and degenerous Children, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilfullie run out of her houſe, to follow their owne pleaſure and fancies; or are for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re feare, falne away from her and forſaken her ordinances.</p>
                  <p>M. Abbot admitting as it were, <hi>that other churches should according to S. Irenaeus rule, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues in matter of doctrine to the church of Rome:</hi> yet to giue vs a taſt of the ſubtility of his shifting witt, addeth, <hi>that ther is in that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Irenaeus nothing for her ſuperiority in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>well, that being once granted, that all other churches should for matter of doctrine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the church of Rome; it would the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron neceſſarily follow, that the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and conſequently his maieſtie ought to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2473:93"/> do the ſame: which was all that I ſued for. yet over and beſides, Irenaeus words being well weighed do import alſo a ſuperiority in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, to be reſident in that church. which I proue, bicauſe he ſaies, that other churches <hi>muſt of neceſsity accord with the church of Rome for her more pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t principality.</hi> Now if the church of Rome haue power and principality over other churches; And do impoſe a neceſſitie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them of according vnto it: it muſt needes haue ſuperiority in goverment over them: or els the other could not be bound of neceſſitie to follow it. <hi>M.

And that it maie bee potent alſo, to move by example and perſwaſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not by commaundement.</hi> Be it ſo, that theſe words maie be wreſted into ſome ſuch ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: as what words be there, that may not be diuerſlie conſtrued? yet everie reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man will ſoone ſee, that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie,</hi> do properly import a commaunding ſuperiority.

                  <p>Againe, ſeing that power and ſuperioritie did (even as S. Irenaeus expreſſeth) impoſe a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie vpon others of conforming themſelues to the church of Rome: it could not bee that imagined ſuperioritie of M. Abbots, which

Thus much here to prove that the principall church in that place of S. Ciprian, is to be taken for the principall in authoritie and goverment. Now to the other part. S.

S. Ciprian ſuppoſeth, that their churches in Afrike, had no leſſ authority then others churches to order ſuch matters; but neither names the church of Rome, nor

                     <p>This councell of Africk, and fact of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican Bishops there aſſembled, is very often in all proteſtants mouthes and writings; therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I will more particulerly examin it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſomwhat a longer ſtaie vpon it. M. Abbot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitts two faults in his firſt allegation out of the ſixt canon of that councell. the former of ignorance, in that he doth applie that to the Bishop of Rome, which the councell ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Archbishop of Carthage, their owne primate and Metropolitane: whom though they would haue to be obeyed, as primats are in all other countries: yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that hee should forbeare that ſtatlie ſtile and title of primacie, and be contented to be called Bishop of the firſt ſea. his other fault is an audacious averring them to deny that Bishop to haue any authoritie ouer them; of which in that canon there is never a word But the plaine contrarie is therin implied. For they there ſpeaking of their owne Metropolitane, they muſt needs bee vnderſtood (being no Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes) to acknowledg him to haue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie over all other Bishops in the ſame provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. In the 101 Canon (which M. Abbot doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2473:96"/> in the ſecond place) he over reacheth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not a little. For wheras thoſe Bishops do humbly requeſt his holines, not to grant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to everie one that shall come to Rome to demaund them; he ſaies they willed the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe not to intermeddle at all in their matters. And in the third place cited by them, to witt, Canon 92, there is a notorious falſification. for wheras that councell doth forbid onlie prieſts and deacons, &amp; other inferiour perſons to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to Rome: M. Abbot ſaies, they forbid all appeales: wheras they ſpeake not of Bishops, of whom principally the queſtion was: but leaue that in the ſtate wherin it was before. This by the waie, to shew how corruptly M. Abbot cites his authors, and how litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce hee makes, to deceiue his ſeely reader, that is ſo ſimple as to believe what he ſaith. Now to the maine matter of the 101 Canon, which hee cites in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place, which well conſidered, doth rather confirme the popes authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe Africane Bishopes, then infirme it. For albeit the Bishops of Africk did not ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg any ſuch canon to be in the councell of Nice, which by the popes legat was alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prove that appellations might be made out of Africk, or anie other countrie vnto Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in ſome caſes: yet they did ſo behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therin, that anie reaſonable man may perceiue their great affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto the ſame ſea of Rome. For they not finding in their owne copies of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene counſell that which was put into the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2473:97"/> Legats inſtructions, deſired reſpite to make enquiry after the beſt copies, and in the meane ſeaſon promiſed obedience: Theſe be their words.

                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:2473:98"/> meant the ſame canons of the councell of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica, which they called the Canons of the Nicene councell: becauſe that councell of Sardica was both holden by ſome of the ſame principall perſons that were at the Nicene councell, <hi>as Hoſius, Athanaſius,</hi> and ſuch like; and did alſo treat much about the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. wherfore it is ſaid to be ioyned in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man copy with the councell of Nice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as an appendix or parcell of it. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin perhaps was the errour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, that the popes having both theſe councells com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact into one, named the canons of both, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the more principall and more renowmed councell of Nice: calling them the canons of the Nicene councell; which in rigour were but the canons of the councell of Sardica. yet that councell of Sardica being of the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and binding power, they in alleaging them vnder the name of the Nicene, did not offer any wrong vnto thoſe Bishops of Africk, exacting onely that that their right might bee preſerved entire among them, which by the approued canons of the church, was due vnto their ſeat. And theſe reverend prelates of the African church were the more excuſable, for that they had not ſeen perhaps any true copie of the approued councell of Sardica at that time; the place being verie remote from them, and the litle ſpace of time, which was betwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene the two councels of Sardica and Afrike, having been alſo moſt trobleſome, by reaſon of the Arrians manifold violent perſecutions.

                     <p>well howſoever it were for the reſt, certain it is to M.

                     <p n="27">27 Now I come to examine what M. Abbot can ſaie againſt the evidence which I produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of S. Ciprian,<note place="margin">Cyprian. Epiſt. <hi>55.</hi> iuxta Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meli.</note> my ſecond witneſſes de poſition, in favour of the ſame church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, his words bee theſe (which we touched before vpon another occaſion) <hi>After theſe things, yea they having furthermore a falſe Bishop ſet over them by heretikes, yet they preſumed to ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le vnto S. Peters chaire, (whence prieſtly vnity doth ſpring) and cary with them letters from ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes, and prophane perſons: not remembring the Romans (whoſe faith is by the Apoſtle prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) to be ſuch men, as perfidie can haue no acceſſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2473:110"/> to them. Ad quos perfidia non poteſt habere acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</hi> Becauſe perfidia is the contrarie to fides, and here by S. Cyprian oppoſed to the faith of Romans commended by S. Paul, I with perfidiouſnes (which hath alſo another ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) did for explications ſake, <hi>ioyne fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in matter of faith.</hi> Againſt which M. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot excepteth, as that which turneth S. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians words, from his true meaning. for he ſaith, <hi>that it made nothing for S. Ciprians purpoſe to ſay, that error in faith could haue no entrie to the Romans. becauſe the queſtion then was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any point of faith, but about matter of Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the bad demeanors of ſome perfidious Africans: who hauing been iuſtly punished at ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, fled to Rome for reliefe, and were like to abuſe the pope with falſe tales, if hee tooke not the better heed vnto their reports. It was therfore imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> (ſaies M. Abbot) <hi>to ſaie in ſuch a caſe, that error in faith could haue no acceſſe to Rome.</hi> Yet he was not ſo blind, but did ſee that on the other ſide it were much more impertinent, yea vncredible that ſuch a graue wiſe prelate as S. Ciprian was, should affirme that perfidious and vntrue informations in matter of fact could find no entrie in the court of Rome. He (I ſay) conſidering this abſurdity is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a great exigent, and hardly can with all his skill excuſe that glorious martyr from colloging, and gloſing (which no man did more abhorr then hee) and from too exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue commendation of the Roman courts integrity, in ordering matters brought vnto
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2473:110"/> it by appeale, out of other countries. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any man of experience yet held (as I wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne) that the court of Rome could not giue eare to falſe informations in matter of law, if they looked not the better about them. well to come to the anſwer, there we haue firſt the ancient cuſtome of appealing out of Africk to Rome confirmed by ſaint Ciprians authority, and that by M. Abbots own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, that the word <hi>(perfidia)</hi> is to be taken rather for error in faith, then for perfidious reports, appeareth, for that it is there by S. Ciprian oppoſed as the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the true faith of the Romans which was by ſaint Paul commended: and in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Epiſtle ſaint Ciprian ſaith: <hi>nulla ſocietas fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei &amp; perfidiae poteſt eſſe:</hi> ſtill oppoſiing perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes to faith. So is it in the 57. Epiſtle, where he affirmeth, that if a novatian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike should be put to death by the heathen perſecutor for the Chriſtian faith: that death to him that dieth out of the church, should bee, <hi>non corona fidei, ſed paena perfidiae,</hi> not a crowne of faith, but a punishment of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and hereſie.</p>
                     <p>Againe, that you may perceiue there to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue been good cauſe for S. Ciprian to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the faith of the Romanes, you muſt obſerue that there is mention made in the ſame ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, <hi>of falſe Bishops choſen by heretikes,</hi> who ſailed towards Rome: were not they fitt inſtruments
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2473:111"/> to prepare the way to hereſie and miſbelief? and towardes the end of the ſame Epiſtle he plainly intimateth, that they were to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by heretikes, when he ſaith: albeit I knew you could not be taken with the veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of haeretikes &amp;c. It was then not beſides the purpoſe to intimate, that ſuch fellowes should find cold entertainment of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, vnto whom miſbelief could haue no acceſſe. beſids in the next period going befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſpeaking of the ſame ſailers to Rome, he caſt this imputation vpon them: <hi>quibus ſatis non fuit ab Evangelio recedere. who thought it not enough for them to depart from the goſpell.</hi> And was it then from the purpoſe, to giue them that caveat, that they were like to loſe their labour in ſailing to Rome for relief? Bicauſe miſbelief could not bee welcome to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, whoſe faith the Apoſtle had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In a word, was it not iuſt as much to S. Cipria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s purpoſe, to ſaie that falshood in faith, could haue no acceſſe to the Romans, as to ſpeake of the Romans faith, commended by the Apoſtle? where faith being (as everie man ſeeth) to bee taken properly, it muſt needs argue, that that perfidiouſnes in the next line lincked with the other muſt be taken for the flatr contrarie. Seing then that the nature of the word doth allow that ſignification, which I gaue it, and ſaint Ciprian did ſo vſe it often in that ſence, namely when he oppoſeth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith; the circumſtances alſo of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and Authors intention better agreing with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2473:111"/> the ſame: it is evident that M. Abbot doth but cauill againſt the true ſence of the word w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich I gaue; And would very abſurdly haue it ſo taken, that you muſt either plainly ſaie, that S. Ciprian ſpake gloſingly and vntruly; or els did ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gely miſtake his words: putting (could) for (should.) <hi>Ad quos perfidia non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt habere acceſſum:</hi> for, <hi>non debuit habere acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</hi> vnto whom (ſaith S. Cyprian) perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can haue no acceſſe. vnto whom (ſaith his corrector, or rather corruptor M. Abbot) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſnes ought to haue no acceſſe. Betwixt which two propoſitions there is verie broad difference, as each man knoweth. Now that in ſome rare caſe, <hi>non poteſt,</hi> is taken for <hi>non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> it cannot, for it ought not: doth not enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that it muſt be ſo taken, when it pleaſeth M. Abbot; but hee muſt giue men leaue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and to follow the naturall and vſuall ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification of the word, before ſuch a ſtrange interpretation and wreſting therof.</p>
                     <p>To that which in the end of his needles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (of it cannot, for, it ought not) Hee addeth; <hi>that S. Ciprian with a councell of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Bishops did teach the rebaptiſing of them that were before baptiſed of heretikes, againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſentence of pope Stephen.</hi> whence it followeth (ſaith M. Abbot) <hi>that they thought they might in matter of doctrine diſſent from the Bishop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or els they would haue ſubmitted their opinion vnto his verdict.</hi> To which I anſwere: That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they tooke that doctrine which the pope
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2473:112"/> of Rome deliuered vnto them in his letters, to be deliuered as his owne priuat opinion, to which they were not bound to conforme themſelues: Or els that in the heat of vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their errors, as they declined from the true doctrine, ſo they forgot their dutie to the ſea of Rome.

Abbots exception might take place; that forſooth for three or fower hundreth yeares it should not faile; but for a 1000. yeeres after it should mightely bee corrupted. which if it were admitted, it had been truer to haue ſaid that their faith should faile, then that it should not faile. becauſe for longer time according to their fantaſicit had failed, then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued without faile. wherfore, that their new gloſe (being directlie oppoſite to our bleſſed Sauiours owne words, which are without anie limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time) is to bee abhorred, as that which doth corrupt the text: and the old doctors moſt literall interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee imbraced. vnto S.

I do now ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more particulerly vpon thoſe holy fathers words, bicauſe M.

Now that Optatus did prove the Donatiſts, to be a particuler ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling congregation like the Proteſtants, not only for that they did not comunicate with the church of Rome, but alſo for want of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the churches of Aſia, that makes nothing againſt the ſinguler eſteeme hee had of the church of Rome. for learned writers do vſe diuers ſorts of arguments to make their partie the more ſtrong and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. One argument not deſtroying, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the other. The Donatiſts were ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes (ſaith that noble Author) bicauſe they oppoſed themſelues againſt the church of Rome. They were alſo aſtraying company, for that they held no communion with the churches of Aſia, or any other part of the world beſides Africa.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the ſea of Rome was nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th? wheras contrary wiſe acute diſputantes, (like to wiſe warriours,) do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly range the ſtrongeſt arguments in the forefront. Or is there nothing to our purpoſe in the former place of S. Auſtin, as here M. Abbot (having put on a braſen forhead) doth avouch? Turne to it good Reader, and ſee. <hi>Firſt that profound Doctor teacheth, that among all the ſucceſſions of Bishops, that of Rome is moſt to be regarded: bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the gats of hell shall never preuaile againſt it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that there had ſitten from Peter vnto Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius then pope; about fortie popes, and that not ſo much as one of them had been a Donatiſt, wherfore the Donatiſts were to be reiected of all men. Hee thirdly teacheth in the ſame place, that if any trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor should by chance creepe into that chaire of Rome
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2473:120"/> yet the wickednes of that man should not be preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall vnto the innocent faithfull, that do rely vpon Chriſts promiſe made to that chaire: bicauſe our Saviours ſinguler care therof is and wilbe alwaies ſuch, that they who put their truſt therin, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be confounded.</hi> Is all this nothing to our purpoſe, that the gats of hell cannot prevaile againſt the chaire of Rome? That they who rely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, cannot faile, no not if there should be a naughty Bishop ſitting in that chaire? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides as S.

                     <p>M. Abbot proceedeth to another great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledg, which I related in honor of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch of Rome, to witt, that there hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en any generall councell of vndoubted and ſound authority, vnleſſe it were by the ſame ſea confirmed. which is a point of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that whoſoeuer doth maturely ponder it, it is alone ſufficient to perſwade him in all controverſies of religion, to make his recourſe vnto the church of Rome, and to follow that full and wholy, which he shall find to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued by it. For if the wiſeſt and moſt learned heads of the world, aſſembled together in a generall councell, after all their owne adviſes vpon long examination of all particulers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, do yet hold it expedient, to ſend to the pope of Rome, to haue his approbation and confirmation therof: how much more ought any particuler perſon (be he of never ſo exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite gifts for iudgment and literature) to referr himſelf vnto the determination of the ſame ſeat? whervnto what doth M. Abbot anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were? firſt as it were he granteth that it is in deed a thing greatly to be obſerved. yet that he may not ſeeme therby to be driven to a dumb blank, he ſaies: <hi>That it is as greatly to be noted, that the ſentence of no bishop of Rome, was anciently holden ſufficient for the deciding of a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of faith, except the ſame were confirmed by a generall councell.</hi> which his aſſertion is not true, as I will preſently prove, after I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue diſproued his ſeely proofe therof;

                        </note> 
                        <hi>that Leo the great doth make mention of an Epiſtle of his, againſt the hereſy of Eutiches ſent to be confirmed by the vniuerſall aſſent of the whole Synode. Item, he nameth certain other writings of his, as having the confirmation of the generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell added thervnto. And that he ſent Deputies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the generall councell of Epheſus, by ſentence in common to decree with the reſt, what should bee pleaſing to god.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is not this a poore proof, out of the fact of one pope to gather a common law for all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes? one pope (forſooth) had ſome ſentences of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by a generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell; therfore neither he, nor any other could giue any se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce availeable, vnles it were confirmed by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councell. what an abſurd paralogiſme is this? true it is, that popes do commonly, when there is any generall councell called, ſend their legates thither, to bee the preſidents of the councell; and vſe to deliuer to them their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne opinions alſo in manner of inſtructions: partly to direct the councell, and in part alſo that they may be more maturely and thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcuſſed and ratified, by the ſame councell. not that they could not many times ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly otherwiſe with the aſſiſtance of their owne learned councell at home, or of ſome one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, define what were to bee beleeued and holden: but for that matters ſo fully ſifted and debated, as they are in a generall councell, may with more facility and fuller applauſe, be receiued of all perſons through the whole world; And namely of them that haue been
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2473:122"/> deceiued by heretikes: who do generally ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to make the ſea of Rome ſo odious to their followers, that they will not like of any thing that comes from Rome alone, be it never ſo true and cleere. For the ſake of ſuch abuſed ſoules ſpecially, there needs the Aſſembly of generall councells, though the Popes ſentence without them were neuer ſo well aſſured. To that alleaged here by M.

                     <p>Now that many hereſies haue been extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the popes of Rome with the aid of provinciall councels, without the helpe of any generall, is moſt manifeſt to them that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re converſant in the ancient hiſtories of the church. and therfore M.

Secondly, that the church of Rome was that ſea Apoſtolike, which had obtayned the top of authority, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes in vaine barking round about it: yet preſently, as if he had wholy forgotten that which ſtood before his eies, ot els not caring what hee ſaid to avoid a dumbe blanck; he falleth to his old byas, and flieth back to that which he ſaid in the beginning, albeit it had been ſo often before confuted: That forſooth, the church of Rome is only the principall church, and fitteſt to bee taken for inſtance in ſucceſſion in weſterne churches, but it hath not (ſaith hee) any ſuperiority in goverment. when as S. Auſtin plainly teacheth, that wee muſt repoſe our ſelues in that churches boſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2473:127"/> and ſet vp our reſt vpon her decrees, that is, be ſure to ioyne in faith and religion with the Bishops of the ſame; and that bicauſe that church hath obtayned the top of Authority, and higheſt degree in goverment. M. Abbot confeſſing the former part of the ſentence to belong to the church of Rome, hath left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no shadow of reaſon to diſmember from it, that which S. Auſtin doth ſo expreſly ioyne and linke with it. <hi>Heare once againe his words. shall we doubt to repoſe our ſelues in the boſome of that church, which ever by the confeſsion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind &amp;c: hath obtayned the top of authority, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes barking round about it?</hi> Do you not ſee even by the cleere words of S. Auſtin, that he muſt confeſſe himſelf not to be a member of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that will deny that church (which he there ſpoke of) to haue the top of authority? what then shall become of M. Abbot, that granteth the church there ſpoken of to be the church of Rome, yet will not confeſſe it to haue that top of authoritie? Either he muſt be raſed out of the number of men, or at the leaſt be ranked in the rew of thoſe hereticall men, that did ſo vainly barke againſt that ſo apparant truth, which the ſound corps of all true beleeving men, do moſt conſtantly and gloriouſly confeſſe. I hauing before shewed at large, how neither S. Auſtin, nor the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Bishops did deny anie one branch of the Bishop of Romes primacy, no not ſo much as forbid their owne Bishops to appeale vnto the court of Rome: And did otherwiſe in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2473:128"/> ſundry ſorts declare their dutifull obedience vnto the ſame ſea of Rome: M. Abbots infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence out of his owne miſtaking and error, is wholy diſappointed. To conclude then this paragraff it doth remaine moſt aſſured and cleere, that our bleſſed Saviour made S. Peter and his ſucceſſors, that rock vpon which he built his church, therby giving them ſupreme power and authority, to govern his whole church, not for any limited nunber of yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but for ſo long as his church should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a church, that is, to the worlds end, for againſt it the gats of hell shall never prevaile. Secondly, it is as certen that the Bishops of Rome be in that charge of government ouer all the church, S. Peters lawfull ſucceſſors: with whom therfore whoſoeuer ioyneth in matter of faith and religion shall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued nor fall in to ſchiſme. and againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſoeuer barketh and oppoſeth himſelf, hee not only barketh and laboreth in vaine, (as S. Auſtin ſpeaketh) but if he do obſtinatly perſever therin, he therby (to vſe Optatus words before rehearſed) becometh both a ſinner and a ſchiſmatike. From which moſt hainous crimes our ſweet Saviour of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit mercie and goodnes deliuer all my moſt deere frinds and beſt beloued countrymen.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, it being admitted that the churche of Rome may be taken for all churches agreing in faith with it: yet it remaineth ſtill a particular church; bicauſe there be many other churches in Europe and Aſia, that do not agree with it in faith, nor acknowledg her chiefty ouer their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For example, the churches of Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, and ſuch like in Europe; and certain other ſchiſmaticall churches in other parts of the world. And as in the time of the Roman Empire, there were many other kingdomes in the world: ſo now beſids the Roman church, there be many other churches.

                     <p>IN this ſection is diſcouered a ſecond falacy of that falſe argument, which they ſo often vſe. <hi>No particuler church can be the Catholike church; but the Roman is a particuler church, Ergo it cannot bee the Catholike church.</hi> In the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſection, I haue laid open the manifold faults of this their argument; shewing firſt the concluſion (if it were granted) not to bee to the purpoſe. for the point in queſtion was not whether the Roman church were the whole Catholike church or no: but whether the word <hi>Roman</hi> in ſtile might bee couched with
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2473:130"/> the Catholike church, that is, whether one might ſenſybly and trulie ſaie and write; <hi>The Catholike Roman church:</hi> they ſay yea, we ſay no, to make good their aſſertion, they a vouch the church of Rome not to be the whole chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch: we anſwere that the proof is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe, albeit that were true, for though it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not the whole church, yet it might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of the whole: not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery part of that kind may be called by the name of the whole; but alſo for that it is ſuch a part as shall neuer be ſeperated from the whole: and conſequently as in exiſtence it is alwaies cloſe coupled with the whole, ſo may it very well in ſtile be interlaced with it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly I affirmed that taking the church of Rome for a part, yet it being the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part, it might very iuſtly giue name to the whole, according to that axiome appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all the learned; <hi>A parte principaliore denominatur totum.</hi> the whole is named af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome principall part. the whole land of Iſraël was called Iury, of the principall tribe therof Iuda. And our own country wherin dwelt both Saxons and Vites aſwell as English men, was named England, when one of the English attained to the monarchy. in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the church of Rome being the head of the reſt (as before I haue prooued) though it be not the whole yet may very well denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te the whole. And ſo it hath done by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both friends and foes. for as we tearme all of our religion, Roman Catholikes. ſo the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2473:130"/> proteſtantes do nickname them Papiſts or Romaniſtes, both taking the name from Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or the bishop of Rome. wherfore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that that common hackney of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants doth not conclude the point that was in queſtion: which no man doubteth to be one of the fowleſt faults, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in arguing. I laid in a ſecond exception againſt the ſecond propoſition of that argument which is, <hi>But the Roman church is a particular church.</hi> For that the Roman church may bee either taken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely for the Dioceſe of Rome; or more larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the faithfull diſperſed through the w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole world, that do imbrace the ſame faith, which they of Rome do profeſſe. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church ſo taken (ſay I) is no particular church, but extends it ſelf vnto the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bounds of the whole Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch. to which M. Abbot doth make anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were in this ſection: And in the begining confeſſeth verie ſtrangley, <hi>that hee is one of thoſe Doctors, that do not vnderſtand this new found diſtinction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee might perhaps haue ſaid truly, that hee liked it not: but for a Doctor to ſay, that hee could not reach to that, which a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newitted ſcholler would make no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to conceiue, cannot bee but a great diſparagement either to his witt, or to his will, or to both. About the firſt acception of the Roman church there is no manner of doubt; And touching the 2. what difficutie is it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2473:131"/> to vnderſtand all thoſe to bee members of the Roman church, who take the Bishop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to bee their chief paſtor, and beſides are in all articles of faith, and forme of government vnited with the Roman. Do not the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts themſelues in euery countrie, by nicknaming vs <hi>Romaniſts, and Papists</hi> giue all men to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that they take all ſuch to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Roman church? If then both in England, France, Germany, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by the teſtimonie aſwell of proteſtants as Catholikes, all they that in faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion agree with the church of Rome, bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for members of the ſame church: would any man maſter of his owne wits make any difficultie to grant that all ſuch may be ſaid to bee of the church of Rome? And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the church of Rome may bee taken to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all them of what nation ſoeuer they bee? what warrant I can bring for this out of the ancient writers shalbee shorrly after she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed; though this matter be in it ſelf ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and almoſt palpable, that hee muſt needs confeſſe himſelf to be little better then a verie blockhead that cannot vnderſtand it. yea M. Abbot preſently after shewes himſelf to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that well enough, for better aduiſed he admits it for true, and diſputs againſt it in this manner. <hi>Be it ſo, that the church of Rome is vſually taken to ſignifie other churches ſubmitting themſelues to the church of Rome; yet it doth not comprehend other churches that do not ſubmit themſelues to the ſame, nor acknowledg her chiefty
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2473:131"/> As the proteſtant churches in Europe, and ſome ſchiſmaticall churches in Aſia.</hi> Ah ſir, you shew cleerly enough that you vnderſtood before that diſtinction of mine, why then did you that wrong to your owne reputation, as to confeſſe your ſelf to be one of thoſe Doctors that could not conceiue it? You meant then (belike,) to make ſome ſimple foole beleeue, that I to vphold my part was forced to coyne a new found diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer heard of before: but the wind being preſently changed, it is but an ordinary and vſuall diſtinſtion, and may bee anſwered in the manner that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue endeuored to anſwere it. To which I replie briefly and roundly, that thoſe churches w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich acknowledg not the chiefty of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch of Rome, or do obſtinatlie denie any other article of the chriſtian faith profeſſed by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me church, be no Orthodox nor true chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at all; but either hereticall or ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call congregations, members onlie of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant church. And therfore though the church of Rome do not comprehend them, yet it doth neuertheles comprehend all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dox and Catholike churches. That all thoſe malignant churches, and euerie member of them that either err in matter of faith defined, or are by ſchiſme deuided from the church of Rome be no true churches at all, To omit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe other arguments, (becauſe this is not a place to handle at large that queſtion) let the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe few teſtimonies ſuffice.

Againſt whoſe error I meane god willing to make a chapter in this booke, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herfore I will not here ſtand to confute it: But admitting it here for paſſable, I do not ſee any reaſon why in the waie of that opinion, the Roman church may not comprehend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe vnpure churches too. For albeit they do not acknowledg the chiefty of the Roman church, nor agree with it in all articles of faith yet they acknowledging the Roman to hold all thoſe fundamentall articles of faith, muſt needs grant that they do agree with it in all points that are of neceſſitie to bee beleeued. On the other ſide they cannot deny but that they are all deſcended out of the ſame Roman church; not being able to shew any other ſtocke or pedegree, out of which their church is iſſued and ſprung. why then should they not yeeld that honor vnto the ſame, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg themſelues members of her from whom they deriue their deſcent and pedigree? and with whom they do agree in all fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers therof: yet there be not, nor cannot bee many chriſtian churches, wherof the one is not a member of the other. For all Chriſtian creeds do teach vs to beleeue, that there is but one only church, not many:<note place="margin">

So that though there be many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct kingdomes independent one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet there cannot bee many ſuch chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but all and euerie particuler true church is a true member of the one only Catholike church. All of them perfectly agreeing togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſociety of faith, in vnity of ſacraments and in forme of government. Conſequently, the head &amp; mother church, (ſuch as before I haue proued the Roman church to bee) may convenientlie bee vſed to ſignifie all the reſt. No man denies the more proper ſignification of the church of Rome to bee the city or Dioceſe of Rome it ſelf; in which ſenſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Pighius doth truly ſay of it, <hi>That it is a particular church, and not to be taken for the vniuerſall church:</hi> Notwithſtanding it is

Saint Ciprian ſent the copie of Antonianus letter to Cornelius bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">Cipr. epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtola <hi>52.</hi>

                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:2473:137"/>
                     <p>wherfore M. Abbot was fowly deceiued, when he ſaid that the word <hi>Roman,</hi> was a tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of diminution, or that it abridgeth the w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole vnto a part; wheras the Roman is fully as large and ample, and hath the very ſame, and no narrower limits and borders then the Catholike faith and religion: excluding none of any nation of the world out of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but heretiks only and ſchiſmatiks, and ſuch like counterfeit Catholikes. And let him and his companions that blush not to lay that imputation of ſect and ſchiſme vpon the Roman church declare if they can, from what church the Roman deuided it ſelf? in what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes daies it became ſchiſmatike? And in what countrie was the vnity of the true church then preſerued? None of all which if they bee able to declare, we muſt needs take their words for wind, if not for paſſionat and womanish ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without any colour of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>I maruell where M. Abbot hath read, that it is the peculiar badg of Antichriſt, to chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to him &amp; his alone to be the whole church of Chriſt. May not Chriſts lieutenant on earth chalenge that truly, which Antichriſt by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion will preſume to do vniuſtly? Or is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re no whole church of Chriſt in the world out of Antichriſts tents? And may he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thought to rove at random, then to ſpeake in his right ſenſes, that averreth Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to bee willing to ſtand for Chriſt, and to profeſſe to fight vnder Chriſts banner? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom as the holy ſcripture and ancient

My promiſes are, not the practiſe only of Catholiks but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Proteſtants, who in all countries giue vs a name taken from the church of Rome, as Romaniſts or Papiſts; to ſignifie that we all be members of the ſame church in what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſoever we dwell; And not only men of our d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Againſt which it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing that heretiks and ſchiſmatiks be no members of the church of Rome: for they be no better then rotten boughes cutt of from the vine, &amp; like ſcattered sheepe out of Chriſts fold, wherfore no part nor parcell of Chriſts church.</p>

                        </gap>ondly I ſay, that it is a fault in arguing when a word is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Metaphorically, to take hold vpon anie other property of the Metaphore, beſides that wherin the reſemblance lieth. I gaue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample, that our bleſſed Saviour is called a Lion for his invincible fortitude. Now if anie man would out of that metaphore ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that our Saviour had foure feete, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe a Lion hath ſo, he should be not only ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, but alſo blaſphemous. In like manner though the church of Rome be by vs called the head church, bicauſe of her ſuperiority:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2473:139"/> Yet doth it not follow, that anie other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties belonging to a head, be of neceſſity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ſame church.

For that the Catholike church is, <hi>totum ſimilare,</hi> a whole conſiſting of parts, that bee all a like as the ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is: every part wherof is called by the name of the whole, as euery part of the aire, is called the aire, euery part of water, is called water: ſo every particular church, that is part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, may truly be called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church: though it be not the whole Catholike church.

Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſucceſſors the Bishops of Rome should enioy the ſame ſoveraigne authority, ouer the whole Catholike church vntill the worlds end. which I made good ſpecially by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and acknowledgment of the greateſt Patriarks, moſt learned and beſt approued Prelats of the Eaſt churches; becauſe the better learned Proteſtants do after a manner grant vnto the Bishop and pope of Rome,<note place="margin">Of this read more in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te at the end of this chapter.</note> as patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the weſt, ſupreme authoritie and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ouer all the weſt churches. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, becauſe the proteſtants do all and ſome obiect that fact of the African Bishops, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin they ſeemed to deny appeales of all vnder the degree of Bishops vnto the court of Rome, as an argument of great moment againſt the ſaid ſupreme commanding power of the ſea

Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a taſt of this firſt branch which is falſe on both ſides. for neither was Cartenna in Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, but in Mauritania: nor did the Donatiſts hold their pretended Catholike church to bee at Cartenna, but eſteemed the Rogatiſts (who ſo much magnified Cartenna) to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Schiſmatiks, altogether vnworthy the name or communion of their ſuppoſed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik church; as S.

                        <hi>I</hi> Confeſſe I committed ſome overſight by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that generally of the Donatiſts, which belonged only to the Rogatiſts. Let this be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus. The Donatiſts did ſet vp a particular church, all of them firſt in the ſouth of Africa, ſome afterward (as the Rogatiſts) at Cartenna in Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania. And ſo haue the Papiſts done at Rome in Italy. Againſt which M. Bishop giues two exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2473:143"/> 
                        <hi>Firſt, that they do not hold the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church to be incloſed within the wals of Rome, as the Rogatiſts did theirs within Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenna: but do ſay that it was diſperſed all the world ouer; wheras the Rogatiſts congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was holden to be confined within the bounds of Cartenna.</hi> The firſt part of which anſwere on their behalf is falſe; and the ſecond part concerning the Rogatiſts is vayne: for it is falſe that the Romish church is diſperſed over all the world: becauſe the Greeke and Eaſterne churches diſclaime ſubiection to the church of Rome; and alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hough the communion of the church of Rome be farr larger then that was of the Rogatiſts at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenna; yet doth neither of them containe any more then a part. And we cannot doubt but that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiſts would as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>llingly haue had the whole world to ioyne with their church, as the Romans: And ſo it was not by poſition of doctrine that their church was not of larger extent; but forwant of better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. And the exprobration of the ſame mad fancy lieth vpon the church of Rome, to wit, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in the further parts of the world shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſalvation, vnles hee come to Rome, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome place where hee may meete with a Popish prieſt, he cannot be baptiſed or reconciled to God. As touching the ſecond exception though it bee not generally true, that the Donatiſts placed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church at Cartenna, yet it is not altogither vntrue. becauſe the Rogatiſts were a kind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, albeit devided from them by ſchiſme. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine although the Donatiſts did not place the Catholike church at Cartenna, yet they deſigned
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2473:144"/> the place therof to bee Africa; for albeit they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the church by the Apoſtles preaching to haue been ſpred ouer all the world; yet they held that it was perished in all other parts of the world, and onlie remained with their part in Africa: they did not exclude the reſt of the world out of their communion, ſo they would be of their opinion. The foundation of their church was laid in Africa, and from thence they would haue it diſperſed all the world ouer. In the ſame ſort ſtandeth the mattr with the Papiſts, they tell vs that the other patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall ſeas are all either extinguished or fallen into Schiſme, and the Roman church only remayning: whence all other churches of the world are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Pope.</p>
                     <p>They tell vs of ſtrange wonders done amongſt the Indians, whither they know it vnlikly for vs to come to ſearch out the truth: but thoſe nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be converted by them, are either colonies of their owne, or ſome Infidels forced to accept of Baptiſme without religion, or ſuch as by wiles they haue ſurpriſed. Thus is M. Bishop by avoyding to be a Donatiſt by putting the matter ouer to the Rogatiſts, become both a Donatiſt and Rogatiſt, by tying the ſeate of the Catholike church to one only particular place.</p>

                     <p>M. Abbot perceiuing well that hee had behaued himſelf exceeding drowſily in that compariſon between the Donatiſts and Catholikes, yet being (as it ſeemeth) over farr
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2473:144"/> in loue with his owne conceit ſimple though it were, would not ſo giue it ouer: but to make vp the full meaſure of his folly, will needs go forwards with it; and endevoreth not only to iuſtify that which he had before written, but doth alſo make ſome new additions. If I could perſwade my ſelf that my time should bee fruitfully ſpent in anſwering him at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght, I would not deſire greater advantage to be given mee, to diſplay and laie open to the view of the world his lacke of Iudgment, lacke of learning, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cke of honeſtie: but conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon can be no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of edification to the Reader, I hold it not worthy anie amplification, but will abridg it as much as I may: yet ſo, that no ſubſtantiall point of it be left vnanſwered. M. Abbot not finding any poore meanes to vnderproppe his palpable abſurdities, is driven to confeſſe them in the very firſt branch, and doth therfore poſt that over to the latter place, and prepoſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh anſwere before vnto the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of the compariſon; which was, <hi>that we Roman Catholiks do not tie the Catholike church to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rome, as the Rogatiſts did theirs to Cartenna. For we hold that men may be baptiſed and ſaued in anie part of the world, without repayring to the City of Rome, or to the coaſtes adioyning neere ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto;</hi> wheras the Rogatiſts did hold, that in what part ſoever of the world any perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted, he muſt of neceſſity go vnto Carte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na, or therabouts to bee baptiſed and obtaine ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2473:145"/> To which M. Abbot replies that the former part on our behalf is falſe. becauſe our church is not ſpred ouer all the world, and therfore ſaluation cannot bee gotten all the world ouer. for that to obtaine ſalvation as he ſaith, a popish prieſt muſt needs be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out. This reply is not to the purpoſe. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our church bee ſpred ouer all the world or no, of which more shalbe ſaid preſently: yet it is certainly knowen to be in diuers great monarchies beſids Italy: in all which if any perſon be to be baptiſed or reconciled, we ſend them not to Rome to receiue thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, but adminiſter them in the place where the perſon is by the inſpiration of God converted, which is cleane contrarie to the doctrine of the Rogatiſts, that exacted the perſonall repaire of all ſuch convertites to Cartenna, or to her confines which doth moſt cleerly ouerthrow M. Abbots anſwere. Yet to bolſter out his flaggy reſemblance he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that it was not by poſition of doctrine, that the Rogatiſts forced all convertits to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me into that country; but becauſe they had not any Bishops of their ſect els where, which if they had had (as no doubt they deſired to haue) then they who were touched with the preaching of the Goſpell, might haue been baptiſed by them in any other country where theſe godly prelats were. To which I reioyne, that had there been Rogatiſts all the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as they deſired to bee, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no place for this bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of the compariſon, which
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2473:145"/> likeneth the Roman Catholikes to the Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, in that they bee both of them priuate and confined within the compaſſe of ſome particular places. M. Abbot therfore full wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely goeth about to vphold his former reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance by the quite ouerthrow of it. for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein (ſaid he before) ſtands the reſemblance betwene the Papiſts and Rogatiſts, that both of them do reſtraine the vniuerſality of the Catholike church to one particular place or country. And now confeſſing the Papiſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship to be farre larger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Rogatiſts, he flies to this ſilly shift, that the Rogatiſts deſire to haue their church as largly extended as the Romaniſts, that is both of them all the world ouer. So that the wind being come round about and ſitting now in the cleane contrary corner, the reſemblance is to be turned the other way; to wit, that as the Roman church deſireth to be ſpred all the world ouer, ſo did the Rogatiſts. But good Sir tell me I pray you, is it ſufficient to make a church Catholike to deſire to be dilated all the world ouer? Then without doubt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rogatiſts, but all other ſectaries too, were alſo Catholiks; for none of them ſuerly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that deſire. yet being baſtard ſlips, and deſtitute of that vertue, which proceedeth by the trunck of true ſucceſſion from the right roote, they could neuer be generally receiued all the world ouer, and therfore could not bee called Catholikes. wheras the Roman church ingraffed by the Apoſtles in to the true Oliue
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2473:146"/> Chriſt Ieſus through the force of his bleſſed paſſion, and by power of the holy Ghoſt, hath not only deſired to ſpred her branches into all nations, but hath actually performed that her holy deſire. <hi>for truth is ſtrong, and doth prevaile.</hi> wherfore it alone hath worthily archieued the name of Catholike, which all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations haue in vaine gaped after and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>Obſerue by the way M. Abbots groſſe ignorance in two points of our doctrine: the former, when he imagineth vs to hold that no man can be baptiſed to ſaluation without hee meet with one of our prieſts. wheras we teach the Baptiſme even of Proteſtants, be they men, be they women, to bee availeable to ſaluation. The latter, in that he affirmeth vs to hold the ſame of reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; we teaching that any perſon of diſcretion may by true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and repentance obtaine ſaluation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they cannot meete with any prieſt. Let therfore theſe his aſſertions be ſcored vp for an after reckening.</p>
                     <p>Now to the ſecond exception, albeit the Rogatiſts were a Cantell or fragment broken out of the Donatiſts, yet they by their diviſion from them forſooke the name of Donatiſts, and tooke their owne proper name of Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and in that queſtion of the true church were at open warr with the Donatiſts. ſo that it was a groſſe ouerſight in M. Abbot to ſay the Donatiſts held the Catholike church to bee at Cartenna: Becauſe they eſteemed no bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2473:146"/> of that church at Cartennna then of a den of theeues. In like manner they of Cartenna reputed the Donatiſts for damned creatures. wherfore albeit the Rogatiſts in ſome other matter, wherin they did agree with the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, might haue paſſed vnder that generall name: yet they could not in that point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin they were at ſo great ſquare. It is then clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that M. Abbots error therin cannot bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
                     <p>well if he hath hitherto behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like one that being half a ſleepe knew not well what he ſaid; yet now being awaked by his aduerſary hee will (no doubt) ſpitt on his fingers, and take better hold, <hi>ſecundae enim co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitationes ſunt prudentiores.</hi> To it then Iollie Sir, touch the Papiſts home, and if you cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the Rogatiſts vpon them, yet driue them at the leaſt to be Donatiſts, and you shall do ſomewhat. That (ſaith M. Abbot) I will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely performe by this new framed reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. <hi>like as the Donatiſts held the Catholike church to haue perished in all other countries, and to haue remayned only with their part in Africa, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that from thence it might be ſpred into all other nations: Even ſo the papiſts tell vs that the churches in all the farr parts of the world haue failed, that the patriarchall ſeas are all fallen away, and only the Roman remayneth, whence the reſt are to be reduced to the obedience of the pope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This loe ſeemes to be ſomething. True it is that the Donatiſts did in many things
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2473:147"/> things counterfeit the true Catholiks, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt pretended (as all other heretiks co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly do) that their congregation was the only true reformed church, and that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die way to ſaluation was to enter into their ſociety. But this is ſo triviall and common aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to the true Catholike, as to all maner of diſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that hee who delights to enlarge himſelf therin, shall but looſe his time, abuſe his reader, and purchaſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the reputation of a trifler. yet let vs deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the particulars of this new coyned compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and ſee whether it will abide the touch ar noe. The Roman church and the Donatiſts did not agree in the firſt point of that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. for wheras the Donatiſts held the church to haue perished all the world ouer, ſaving in ſome part of Africk: the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doth not hold the true church to haue perished all the world over, ſaving in Italy, or in ſome parts of Europe: but teacheth that it hath alwayes continued, and even in this laſt hundreth yeeres, to haue gained more both in the Eaſt and weſt Indies, then it hath loſt in theſe parts of the world. Secondly, it is not long ſithence all the patriarchall ſeas did ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree with the church of Rome, to wit, in the yeare of our Lord god 1439. as may be ſeen in the councell of Florence, and by the profeſſion of faith which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> patriarch of Conſtantinople,<note place="margin">Concil. florent. ſeſſ. <hi>25.</hi>

To theſe points of doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and to all other of the church of Rome, did at the ſame time ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be the legats and deputies of the other three patriarchall ſeas, <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, and Ieruſalem;</hi> as is recorded in the ſame councell. In which faith continued the ſaid three pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall ſeas, till the yeare of our lord 1517, (when Luther began his tragedy) as ſtands of record in the generall councell of Latera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> held vnder Leo the tenth. where the obedience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Peter</hi> Patriarch of the Armenians vnto the church of Rome was preſented by his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſince which tyme (as ſomtimes alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) albeit thoſe churches for the greater part fell often away into ſchiſme and hereſie; yet there remained alwaies, and do to this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me continue ſtill among them, many good ſoules that do conſtantly retayne and keepe the true doctrine of the church of Rome in all points. And the Greeke church hath in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2473:148"/> it ſelf a Seminary (as many other nations haue) at this daie, to breed and trayne vp their young ſtudents, as in all other vertues and pietie, ſo principally in the true faith of the church of Rome. wherfore albeit the publike face of religion be now in thoſe churches as it is in our countrie, yet there want not true Roman Catholikes in thoſe parts no more then there do (God be thanked) in our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untry to baptiſe, reconcile, and to perfome all other chriſtian duties appertayning to the rites of the Roman church. whence it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that there are two vntruthes in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of M. Abbots new reſemblance; for we are ſo farr of from ſaying the Catholike church to be perished ouer all the world, that wee affirme it rather to be at this preſent day much increaſed and multiplied, which doth controwle the former part of M. Abbots poſition: we ſay more ouer that in thoſe verie patriarchall ſeas, though the outward face of religion be disfigured and corrupted, yet doth the Roman religion remayne there entire and ſound, though not openly countenanced by the ſtate, yet by the godly practiſed in ſecret.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now proceed to the ſecond particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, to wit that the Donatiſts laide the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of their church in Africa, and from thence would haue had all other churches to haue bene reſtored to their former integrity: when did they begin to laie that foundation? about 300 yeares after Chriſt in conſtantine the great his raigne. who was he that laid that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2473:148"/> foundation? One Maiorinus or Donatus, of whom the reſt tooke their name, doth it not herehence (that I go no further) preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare a great difference between the church of Rome, and the church of the Donatiſts? The church of Rome began in the Apoſtles dayes, and had for her chief Architects the princes of the Apoſtles S. Peter, and S. Paul; wheras the Donatiſts began their revolt from the ſaid church of Rome 300 yeares after, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the afore ſaid blind guides. wherfore the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no compariſon to be made betweene ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the foundation or founders of the one with the other. But ſaith M. Abbot. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts gaue their church as gallant and braue a title as the church of Rome had, for they called it the Catholike church: and deſired as earneſtly as the Romaniſtes do, to haue had it ſpred all the world ouer. True for the title of Catholike; true alſo that they had a feruent deſire to haue had it ſpred farr and neare. But their doctrine being the vaine leaſings of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mortall men, had too ſmall force and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it, to diſperſe it ſelf ſo farr abrode; and not being planted by the heavenly father, it did not take any deepe root. ſo that albeit tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe buſy fellowes laboured tooth and naile to in large the limits of their doctrine into the out moſt coaſts of the earth, that it might haue wonn the name of Catholike, yet they could neuer obtaine it, nor come within tenthous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and mile of it. wheras the doctrine and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church of Rome, as a fruitfull tree pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2473:149"/> by the watet ſide, did ſpread her branches nto all nations, and hath even ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles daies even to our time continued a true part of the Catholike church by M. Abbots owne confeſſion, as you shall ſee heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in this chapter. ſo that in fine there is left no reſemblance at all in this reformed part of the compariſon, ſaving that the Donatiſts had a vaine deſire to haue their ſect dilated as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as was the Catholike Roman faith. But it began 300. years after the Roman, and hath not by 1300 continued ſo long, nor yet could for any short ſpace of time dilate it ſelf ſo lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely. wherfore it could not come neere vnto a shadow of the title of Catholike. Touching the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion of the Indies, it muſt needs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve any good chriſtian hart to heare how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuouſly and prophaneliet his vnſanctified Abbot doth ſpeake of it: firſt he writes that we may ſay of their converſion what wee liſt, becauſe thoſe countries are ſo farr of, that they are not like to trauaile ſo farr to ſearch whether we ſay true or no. They are perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture more like to make ſome iournay thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward to ſearch out ſome of the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gold, then to ſeeke after the conuerſion of the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Indian ſoules: yet if they will not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues take the paynes nor vndergo the hazard to win ſoules, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>at leaſt afford others their good word that will refuſe no paines nor pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill in ſo bleſſed an enterpriſe. If there were any ſparke of Chriſtian Charity in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would they not rather reioyce then repine, that the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2473:149"/> faith of Chriſt is ſo vniuerſally embraced, ſo religiouſly obſerued in thoſe moſt ample and rich dominions? If M. Abbot hath not (as hee here pretendeth) inquired after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their conuerſion, how knowes he that there bee ſo few, and they ſo bad Chriſtians? should not an even mind out of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity in caſes vnknowne, iudge the beſt and giue his ſentence rather in fauour of the Chriſtian Religion then againſt it? but M.

                     <p>I haue M. Abbot guilty and confeſſing that hee changed his Authors words, yet never without one idle excuſe or other; he hath (for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſooth) given another word, but which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ſame in effect. If the words had been of the ſame ſignification, yet it had been plainer dealing to haue kept the authors ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne words; but if there be great diuerſity bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene them, then there was litle shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt dealing to shift from the one to the other. who but M. Abbot will ſay, that perfection of Sacraments, and fulnes of Sacraments bee all one? where fulnes is referred to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat number of Sacraments: and perfection may bee attributed to the right vſe of them, or to the vertue and efficacy of them. For they bee two diſtinct controverſies betweene the Proteſtants and vs. The one, how many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments there bee; the other, of what perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and efficacy they are. That is, whether they conferre grace or no. wherfore it was not well done to thruſt in perfection for fulnes, there being ſuch ods betwene the nature and vſe of thoſe two words. Againe, betwene the obſeruation of all Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, and perfection, there is a notable difference in the way of our religion; for it appertains to all the faithfull to obſerue all Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the counſels of perfection are left to the free choice of them, whoſe harts it shall
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2473:152"/> pleaſe God to diſpoſe that way. wherfore if M. Abbot had had an honeſt good meaning he would not haue ſo changed his authors words, but hee more like a Ioly wiſe politike proteſtant, that beleeveth neither the full number of the ſacraments, nor thinketh it poſſible to keepe all Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, flieth from thoſe tearms of fulnes of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and obſeruation of all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> checks and reproues of their new belief; and choppeth in perfection of doctrine bicauſe he can therin better wrangle. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Gaudentius</hi> did ioyne perfect and vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>fulnes;</hi> yet it followeth not therof, that he tooke thoſe words for all one; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ioyned together many words of diuers ſignifications, to explicate more fully the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the word <hi>(Catholike.)</hi>

                     <p>Now to the ſecond member albeit Doctor Briſtow (a man of ſinguler vertue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) and ſome others haue taught the word <hi>(Catholike)</hi> to comprehend within the latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of his ſignification that which is vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect, and halteth in nothing; yet no one of them doth exclude the more vſuall and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter allowed ſignification of the ſame, which is to deſigne the communion and ſociety of the whole world.

                     <p>Some what like hee might haue ſaid, but not all one. for to approue the election of a Bishop, and to elect a bishope, or to conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te him, bee farr different things, as every man
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2473:154"/> that is acquainted with theſe matters can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily tell. I admit Donatiſts would gladly haue had Bishops of their owne ſect in every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, that they might haue had no need to ſend Bishops out of Africa to conſecrate them in other places: And thervpon I do inferr, that euen therby they were convinced not to bee Catholikes. bicauſe their paſtors &amp; preachers were not vniverſally ſpred ouer all countries. contrarywiſe the Roman church is proued to be Catholike, becauſe it had in everie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Bishops of their owne faith and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. So that M. Abbot winding and turning on both ſides to get out of the briars, doth ſtill more and more intangle and faſten himſelf in the ſame.</p>

                     <p>THe fourth point of M.

And the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part taken as true proportion requireth, is not perfect: for wee should not eſteeme men Catholiks for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the church of Rome, if that communion were cloſed vp within the wals of Rome, or within her confines; as the Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2473:154"/> were pinned vp in Cartenna: but for that by communicating with the church of Rome, wee do enter into communion with all other churches of the ſame religion, which are ſpred over all the world.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Said the Donatiſts, I should haue ſaid the Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who expounding the word Catholike for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and perfection of faith, as before wee haue ſeen, and affirming themſelues only to be Catholiks, left it as a conſequent, that none could bee called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks, but by ioyning with them. The Donatiſts were in the ſame error concerning their church in Africa. The Papiſts are like vnto them both, who plead the ſame for the church of Rome: but M. Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop tels vs that they do not call men Catholiks for communicating with the church of Rome, if it bee taken for that particular church, which is cloſed wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin the wals of Rome: which is contrary to that hee taught himſelf a litle before. For he taught before that men became Catholikes by holding the Roman faith, and communicating with the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. but to shift ouer this, hee addeth; that therfore they become Catholiks in communicating with the church of Rome, bicauſe that by that communion, they enter into ſocietie with all other churches of the ſame religion, which are diſperſed all the world ouer. But againſt this it may bee ſaid, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men do not now become Catholike as they did of old: becauſe of old it was enough to communicate with the church spred ouer the world: but now it is to be added, that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2473:155"/> by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication with the church of Rome, wee muſt communicate with the church ſpred ouer all the world. what if the church of the whole word do not hold communion with the church of Rome? as when Arrianiſme had in a manner ouerflowed all the world, and when the Eaſt and weſt churches were deuided from Rome: and before the brood of Ignatius had converted the Indians; whence was the name of Catholike to bee taken then? Put the caſe that all other churches ſaue the Roman do err (as they ſay they maie) how shall a man then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the Roman, communicate with all other churches? then muſt you needs ſaie, that by communicating with that particular church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me you do become Catholike. finally M. Bishop doth overthrow himſelf. For if a man become a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike by communicating with the church of the whole world; and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating with the church of Rome he doth communicate with the church of the whole world: then communicating with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church of Rome, the name of Catholike doth belong to him. To be short, if the Donatiſts could haue had their way, they would not haue doubted to ſay aſmuch of their church, as M. Bishop doth hereof his; to wit, that men should bee called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks by communicating with the African church, not as it was contained within the bounds of Africa, but for that in communicating with that church, you did enter into communion with all other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſpred over all the world.</p>

                     <p>IN the forefront of this chapter M. Abbot ingraued this title: <hi>The compariſon betwixt the Donatiſts and Papiſts iuſtified.</hi> And yet we ſee in the beginning of euery ſection an open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome fault made by himſelf in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me compariſon. I ſaid the Donatiſts, I should haue ſaid the Rogatiſts &amp;c: well, though it cannot be denied but that this is a very ſimple kind of Iuſtification, yet I am content it paſſe for ſome kind of ſatisfaction. be it permitted to M. Abbot for a ſory shift, to flit vp and downe, before from the Rogatiſts in Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania, to the Donatiſts in Africa; now back againe from the Donatiſts to the Rogatiſts: who (ſaith hee) did expound the word Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, of perfection of faith. which to haue been otherwiſe I haue shewed in the ſecond ſection of this chapter. well, <hi>thoſe honeſt Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts affirmed themſelues only to bee true Catholiks, and by conſequence held none to be Catholikes but ſuch as ioyned with them. So did the Donatiſts in Africa. The Papiſts do the like for their church, therfore they reſemble the Donatiſts.</hi> And do not the proteſtants put in the ſame plea for their church? therfore they be alſo Donatiſts. And did not the old Arrians affirme and ſay aſmuch in favour of their church? were they alſo Donatiſts? Is not this then a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance betwixt the Donatiſts and Papiſts, that will agree vnto all kind of ſects? yea vnto
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2473:156"/> the true Catholike church it ſelf, to which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in deed it doth rightfully apperteine. yet it is vſuall to all ſectaries that take their errors for truth, to qualify and grace their ſect with the title of the true reformed church. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance then is ſo triviall, that a man of any sharpnes of wit, would haue been ashamed to haue framed it. But if M. Abbots inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re dry and dull when he propoſed that, we shall now find it fluent and acute in reproving what I anſwered of the church of Rome, to wit: <hi>If the communion of the church of Rome paſſed not out of the wals of Rome, then by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the church of Rome wee should not become Catholiks.</hi> But bicauſe it is farr otherwiſe with the church of Rome, then it was with the church of Cartenna, and that in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the church of Rome, we enter into the communion of the church dilated all the world ouer, therfore wee become Catholiks in communicating with the church of Rome; about which M. Abbot makes a foule fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, but in fine cannot impeach it; hee ſaith firſt it is contrary to that which I had before taught, viz: <hi>to communicate with the church of Rome, was to become Catholike.</hi> But this hee ſaw to be ſo ſimple, that hee corrected it himſelf preſently, for I never ſaid otherwiſe, but by communicating with the Roman church, wee became Catholiks. And my reaſon alwaies was, bicauſe the communion of the church of Rome did reach into all the coaſts of the earth. He giueth the ſecond aſſaut againſt it,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2473:156"/> by averring that therof it would enſue, <hi>that one became Catholike now a dayes, otherwiſe then of old; bicauſe then it was ſufficient to communicate w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Or was there any time ſince the Apoſtles dayes when there was no church of Rome, that one might haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the church ſpred ouer all, and yet not haue communicated with the church of Rome? Yea did not they that wrote againſt the Donatiſts, (I meane S.

S. Auſtin ſaith of Ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus Archbishop of Carthage, who was principally oppugned by the Donatiſts, <hi>that hee holding communion with the church of Rome, as with the chiefeſt Apoſtolicall chaire, needed not care for the conſpiracy of the Donatiſts ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Note how in thoſe old daies, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the pope &amp; church of Rome, the prelat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Abbot puts forth a new caſe. <hi>what if the church of the whole world do not hold communion with the church of Rome, as it was when Arrianiſme did ouerflowe the whole world? Then at leaſt by holding commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Rome, one held not communion with the church of the world.</hi> M. Abbot is content to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the Donatiſts to dreame awhile, and flieth for aduantage to the Arrians, but they will helpe him no more then did the Donatiſtes. For though their hereſies infected many cities &amp; countries, and drew many Bishops to their party: yet M. Abbot I thinke can hardly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me mee any one city of the world ſo wholy poſſeſſed with that Arrianiſme, that it had not at the ſame time many true beleeuers in it, that would not ioyne in faith and religion with the ſaid Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but ſtuck cloſe to the church of Rome, and to all other true beleeuers. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke we ſay of the Eaſterne churches when they fell into ſchiſme and hereſie: that albeit the outward face of their congregations were ſchiſmaticall; yet there remained alwaies in thoſe countries, as there do now in England, very manie that did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly defend and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Roman religion. The Indians for the moſt part of late time were converted: yet many millions of ſoules were wonne vnto Chriſtian religion in the weſt and Eaſt Indies by good prieſts, Franciſcan Fryers, and other religious men, before any miſſion of Ieſuits were ſent into that heavenly harueſt, as the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2473:157"/> Indian ſtorie doth teſtifie, yea before their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was eſtablished and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed. If through the abundance of iniquitie it should come to paſſe, that the Catholike religion should bee cleane rooted out of many countries (for I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke no doubt but that it shall alſo continue in many beſids Rome vnto the worlds end) yet thoſe countries that retaine the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t faith, shall alſo kepe the old title and name of the Catholike church, though their faith be not then ſpred ouer all the world. Becauſe it was the ſame faith which had been in time paſt preached and beleeued ouer all. for no man holdes it neceſſarie that at one and the ſame time, it should be imbraced of all nations. The Donatiſts I grant (if they might haue had their way) would haue ouerſowed their tares in the fields of all countries. They lacked not good will then, no more then the proteſtants do now, to ſow their cockle farr &amp; neere; but with all their toſſing and turmoyling they were not able to infect half Africa only; God ſending vnto curſt cowes short hornes, and not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch ſucceſſe to the falſe doctrine of vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne men, as to his own divine word. when will M. Abbot take out this leſſon, that the church is called Catholike, not becauſe it deſireth and wisheth to bee ſpred ouer all, but for that it is ſo really and actually, at one time or another? which the Donatiſts, proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, nor any other ſectaries were yet ever able to compaſſe; but muſt perforce whether they will or no, leaue that ſinguler priviledge vnto the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church.</p>

He should haue added ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, who died fifteene yeeres before the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te therof; for Gregory the 13. died the tenth of Aprill 1585. Let that paſſe as a light ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, this that foloweth is worſe. for if it ſtand ſtill in that edition vncorrected, why is not that the fault of the corrector rather then the popes, who be not at leaſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ouer newe impreſſions?

                     <p>THis reſemblance is more common then the high way. For men of what religion ſoever they bee, do ſeeke out reaſons to diſſwade others from participation in holy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with all other religions, and ſpecially from that which is moſt contrarie to their owne. And neuer were any ſectaries that deuiſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re lewd and vile ſlanders of any religion, then the proteſtants haue done of the Roman. And among others they do vſe the verie ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of the Donatiſts to diſcourage men from going to maſſe. To wit that there are Images in the churches ſet vpon the high aultars. So that M.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2473:170"/> churches; becauſe long before that, in Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians daies, <hi>there was engraven vpon the chalice (wherin they offred vp the ſacrifice of Chriſts blood) the picture of Chriſt in the forme of a good shepheard carrying home the loſt sheepe on his shoulders,</hi>

They complayned without iuſt cauſe, when they were worthely expelled out of them. they pretended in deed that they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re lawfully diſcended of the former Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Bishops, and that therfore thoſe livings were due to them; which would bee iuſt the proteſtants caſe, if it should pleaſe God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire into our Soveraigne Lord king Iames his hart, to diſpoſſeſſe them of their benefices as vſurpers, and to reſtore the dignities and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings founded by Catholiks for the exerciſe of Catholike religion into the hands of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishops and Prieſts. who ſeeth not therfore how fairly the Donatiſts did in moſt things pourtraict their white ſons the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants?</p>

                     <p>I Muſt needs confeſſe, that I know no cauſe why his Maieſtie in the firſt parlament of his raigne in England, did confirme all thoſe ſevere lawes (with ſome additions) which had been enacted againſt Catholikes in Queene Elizabeths daies. for the ſame Catholikes had as much, if not more, trauailed to make his highnes true title vnto the Crowne of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d knowen, and his perſon acceptable, then the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:2473:176"/> proteſtants, and did as willingly receiue him into the poſſeſſion therof. And albeit ſome few Catholikes did rashly ioyne with proteſtants, to haue attempted the ſurpriſing of his royall perſon out of their hands, whom they preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to abuſe his Maieſty verie much with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and malitious informations: Yet that could hardly bee (in my poore opinion) any iuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to confirme ſo many rigorous lawes againſt the whole body of Catholikes: no more then to haue made the like againſt proteſtants, who were principall ſticklers in that deſperate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. All which conſidered had I not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, writing in that time, to remoue that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which ſeemed to touch his Maieſty, and to impute it rather vnto the malice of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me certaine crept to farre into his royall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and knowen to bee maliciouſly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then to his highnes: who (as many haue reported) did in the beginning of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proteſt that hee would take no ſoule mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that hee would like of no Catholike the worſe for his religion, ſo that otherwiſe hee found him loyall and faithfull. Since the horrible plot of the Gunpowder, though the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re bee more colour for thoſe ſeuere lawes, yet there is in my ſlender iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t no iuſt cauſe. for what equity or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience teacheth, for the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of ſome fewe offenders to punish innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Innocents, that never conſented vnto them, nor were any waie culpable of the ſame crime?

This it is. <hi>S. Auſtin, Optatus</hi> and all antiquity do teſtify, that the maine point of the Donatiſts hereſie conſiſted in this, that <hi>they affirmed the church of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2473:178"/> Chriſt, planted by the Apoſtles, to haue perished all the world ouer, ſaving in thoſe coaſts of Africa, where their party remayned.</hi> Therfore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mainteynes this error obſtinatly, though hee faile in no other article of belief, hee is a very Donatiſt. And whoſoeuer should vphold all the branches mentioned by M. Abbot, or any other that any man els can produce; if hee do not maintaine this, to wit, <hi>that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church is perished in moſt parts of the world,</hi> hee can neuer be come a Donatiſt the reaſon is moſt euident. becauſe hee doth not concord with them in that error, for which they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Chriſtned by that name. As for the error of rebaptization it ſprong vp before their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, and was but an appendix to the other: which the donatiſts vndertook to currie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, where it had been taught before by great perſonages. Now then to the purpoſe, If the Proteſtants do teach the true church to haue perished all the world ouer for many hundreth yeres, ſaving that it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among men of their religion in certaine darke and vnknowne corners, who can deny them to bee as true Donatiſts as ever were any? which M. Abbot perceiuing to bee as plaine as Dunſtable high way, maketh as though the proteſtants never taught the true viſible chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch to haue faild at any time, but to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, euen from Gregorie the great his time downe to our daies, continued viſibly in all theſe parts of the world, though blemished
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2473:178"/> with ſome corruptions; yea that the church of Rome it ſelf was a part therof, as alſo the ancient church of England. doth not this ſeeme ſtrange? was it not their common doctrine that from Pope Boniface his time (that is, for theſe nine hundreth yeres at le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt,) there was a generall Apoſtacy from the true church, and that Antichriſt with his band poſſeſſed the outward viſible church, Gods true church lying hid all that while inviſible, vntill frier Luther caſt of his frock, coupled himſelf with a Nunne, and began to ſet abroach the true light of the new Goſpell? If M. Abbot will not acknowledg it, let him and the reader that doubts of it, but turne to thoſe Authors of our owne country To omitt others: M. <hi>Parkins</hi> in his reformed Catholike page 331.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2473:179"/> among them.) The Proteſtants are Donatiſts and worſe then Donatiſts, for firſt they agreed with the Donatiſts in the eſſentiall point of their hereſie; <hi>that the true church of Chriſt was perished.</hi> And in this they went farr beyond them; for the Donatiſts did not affirme the church to bee perished in all places, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues having for a hundreth yeares and more ſome face of a church in many cities of Africa, and aboue 300 Bishops of their ſect.

Abbot to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide the open profeſſion of that damnable Donatiſme, is faine to fall into a newe phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, that (forſooth) the Roman church notwithſtanding all her groſſe errors and fow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le faults (in their imagination) is a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſts Catholike church: becauſe she held alwaies the foundation entire, though she built hay, ſtraw, and ſtubble theron. well fare your hart gentle ſir, wee are much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vnto you for the good opinion you haue of our church and religion: but how co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes it then to paſſe, that our church her ſelf being ſo hart-whole and tollerable, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers therof bee by you eſteemed ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; horrible? why are the lawfull paſtors therof, only for being conſecrated prieſts, and for coming into England, to execute the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:2473:179"/> and accuſtomed rites of prieſthod made hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous traitors? why are honeſt and otherwiſe harmles men for receiuing of prieſts, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God after the old accuſtomed manner, moſt grieuouſly punished by loſſe of all their goods, lands, libertie and life? how vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and conſcienceles men bee you Miniſters to cry out for ſo ſevere lawes, and moſt bitter execution therof, againſt recuſants for that religion which you your ſelues hold to bee Catholike? If there were any good nature left in you, or ſparke of any kindnes; you should rather intreat pardon for men of our religion, of whom you now chalenge yourſelues to bee lineally deſcended; and in right of which deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent you enioy many high Eccleſiaſticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities, and rich benefices. This in courteſy you ought rather to do, then for humane &amp; tollerable faults to incenſe the prince and ſtate againſt vs. Tollerable I ſay in the courſe of mans law, if Almightie God will beare with them. And if they do not exclude a Chriſtian man out of Gods Catholike church, as they do not in the way of your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why should earthly potentats depriue them of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> benefits of their dominions, and not rather after the example of the ſoveraigne Lord of heaven and earth, ſuffer them to liue quietly in their kingdome, and to enioy their owne livings, which bee rightfully deſcended vnto them from their predeceſſors, men alſo of the ſame religion? I cannot ſee how M. Abbot &amp; all they that imbrace the ſame opinion, can in
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2473:180"/> equity require any recuſant to bee ſo highly punished for that religion, which they hold to bee good in all ſubſtantiall and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points therof, though they thinke it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſmaller moment to neede reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. well; though that their opinion bee more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable and indulgent to vs, yet in my poore iudgment it is farre of from being true. And to my ſlender conceite it doth ſeeme (as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) prodigious, how they can take that chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch to bee a true member of the right church, whoſe head they hold to bee Antichriſt; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſacrifice and common ſervice, Idolatrie; whoſe Sacraments, ſacrilegious ſuperſtitions; the greater part of their doctrine, blaſphemies: their paſtors, beaſts, foxes and ſwine, as M. Abbot here out of his litle ciuility tearmeth them. Briefly, the whole face of their church being (as he raileth and writeth) berayed with the filth of Idolatry. if the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me be ſuch a monſter, as hee would make her, I deſire him to explicate in particular which be thoſe fundamentall points that do conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute church a the true member of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church? In the meane ſeaſon it is pleaſant to heare how roundly hee reckeneth vp wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout either ſtaggering or blushing, the Iolly agreement which hee takes to bee betweene their church and ours. <hi>wee do not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>take vpon vs to bee any other church then that w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich they call the old, but the ſame church refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: wee reteyne ſtill the ſame ſcriptures which

                     <p>what voluntary light babling is this? who ever before M. Abbot tooke the Anabaptiſts to bee papiſts? when as they as ſtifly deny the popes authoritie, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, the reall preſence, the merites of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and moſt other articles of our religion, as any other proteſtants. And albeit they differ from the Sacramentaries in ſome few matters, as the Sacramentaries do alſo from the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans: yet they bee deſcended from them, and do agree with them in moſt points of religion; wherfore they may bee aſwell ſorted and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with them, as the Rogatiſts and Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſts
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2473:181"/> were with the Donatiſts; neither will it helpe M. Abbot to ſay, that they caſt the Anabaptiſts out of their congregation. For the Donatiſts did no leſſe excommunicate and chace out of their churches the Maximianiſts and Rogatiſts, then the Sacramentaries do the Anabaptiſts. It was then rather a foolery of M. Abbots vpon ſo foolish a reaſon to deny the Anabaptiſts to belong vnto the common body of the proteſtants; and more impudent folly is it to aſſociate them to vs, from whom they diſſent further then the other proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do. And becauſe wee bee now entred into degrees of compariſon, let it bee taken for a ſuperlatiue folly in M. Abbot, to divide all men of our religion into Anabaptiſts, Secula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts, and Ieſuiſts. for to returne the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts to themſelues as their owne ſweet brood, with whom they conſent againſt vs in moſt controverſies of religion: Do the other names of Seculariſts, and Ieſuiſts comprehend all Romane Catholikes? bee there no lay Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks at all, nor any other religious perſons in our church beſids ſeculariſts and Ieſuiſts? what was become of M. Abbots ſenſes when hee wrote this? The Seminariſts and Ieſuiſts being compared vnto all other Catholiks both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and lay, do ſcarſe amount, (as I geſſe) vnto the thouſand part of that body. So that here M. Abbot infabling, fumbling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding rather then in diuiding, ſurmounts the higheſt degree of compariſon.</p>

                     <p>THis fourthe reſemblance hitting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſo right on the head, makes M. Abbot ſo to ſtagger, that hee hath not one wiſe word to anſwere in their defence. Is it id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le good S. or of ſmall regard, that the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do reſemble the wicked Donatiſts, in their irreligious and malicious carriage tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the conſecrated houſes of God, yea tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards his bleſſed body in the Sacrament of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2473:184"/> altar, towards holy oyles, veſtments, and all ornaments of the church? Doth it not argue verie apparantly that there lieth lurking in them a verie prophane and ſpitefull ſpirit, that cannot abide the maieſtie of Gods ſeruice; but abhorreth all things thervnto belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto may bee added, that like as the Donatiſts did plucke of the veyles of virgins, wherby they profeſſed themſelues to bee the ſpouſes of Chriſt, and to haue renounced all ſecular marriages, and vaine worldly conuerſation: Even ſo did and do the proteſtants, where any ſuch profeſſed virgins do fall into their hands, robbing Chriſt of his ſpouſes that profeſſe chaſtity, faſting, praier and all holines of life, and turning them out into the wild and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world, there to liue at large like other worldlings. for this loe is a ſpeciall priuiledg of Luthers ſweete Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>Now for that hee fableth of leaguers and Ieſuiſts in France and other countries, hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king without booke, muſt giue mee leaue to beleeve mine owne eies rather then his ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

                     <p>THE laſt point of reſemblance M.

And do they ſeeme new bicauſe they are tranſlated into English meeter, and fitted with plaine and eaſy tunes to ſerue for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vſe? Or is it not laudable to vſe ſongs and pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the church? That the Donatiſts vſed ſuch ſongs in their churches is M. Bishops lie. For Saint Auſtin rather ſignifieth that they vſed them at their drunken bankets. Saint Auſtin commendeth ſober ſinging of pſalmes, and ſo doth Saint Leo.<note place="margin">Leo de col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec. ſer. <hi>4.</hi>

Abbot ſpendeth his mouth in waſt, when hee endeuoreth to recommend vnto vs the laudable vſe of ſober ſinging them in our churches: which their church hath receiued of ours, and hath ſomewhat to do, to maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the ſame ſinging againſt their yonger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the puritanes, who like of no ſuch Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish rites. But how dares M. Abbot to auouch ſo peremptorily, that all their Geneva pſalmes bee nothing els but the pſalms of Dauid? How many peeces and broken ſentences haue they deuiſed of their owne heads to patch the reſt togither, and to make them vp into broken meeter? what, will they ſaie that all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions ioyned and ſowdered to the reſt, bee inſpired by the holie Ghoſt? Or can that trulie bee called a pſalme of Dauid, that hath one ſentence in it not dictated by the holy Ghoſt? But in their meeters manie ſuch ſentences bee added, which are not aſſured to bee of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt: wherfore they may well marre, but cannot make vp any pſalmes of Dauid. Beſids they haue ſome very hereticall ſentences inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded among the reſt: As for example this, in the inuocation of the holy Ghoſt before the Sermon: <hi>Keepe vs from all papiſtry.</hi> Finally there bee ſome whole pſalmes made by
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:2473:185"/> by Robin woodcocke I trow or ſome of his fellowes no leſſe Dunſticall then hereticall. Take for a taſt therof the firſt ſtaffe of the laſt ſong in their pſalter, compoſed by R.

And as for word and Lord, Throne and ſonne; though the words do end in the like ſyllables, yet they agree not in ſound. If M. Abbot would haue the ſimple reader beleeve, that S. Auſtin, and S. Leo (when they ſpeake in the praiſe of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalmes) did meane Davids pſalmes in meeter, let him produce but one good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to teſtify that they were ſo turned wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin 900. yeares of thoſe Doctors deathes, and then hardely beleeue him. If hee cannot, then every man may ſee what credit is to bee given to his allegations. That S. Auſtins words w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich I alleaged are to bee vnderſtood of Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, which the Donatiſts ſung in their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, rather then of ſongs in their drunken bankets; may bee gathered out of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon that hee makes betweene them, and the pſalmes that were ſung in the Catholike
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2473:186"/> church. And S. Auſtin might well by a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore vſuall in the holy ſcripture, call the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts new mad deviſes againſt the ancient cuſtome of grave ſinging in the quire, <hi>their drunkennes.</hi> As for the worshipfull teſtimony of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> of our mingling holie things with prophane, it being recorded in a booke of condemned memorie, I hold it not worth the anſwering. Sure I am that M. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot by producing of ſuch Authors, cracketh his owne credit. for hee promiſed in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the reader, <hi>that hee would only vſe the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie either of ſome learned Bishops of Rome, or of ſome other famouſly approued author,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in that church; And this booke of Agrippa <hi>de vanitate ſcientiarum,</hi> is by name condemned by the ſame church, in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge of forbidden books; wherfore M. Abbot is no man of his word. Finally like to a tatling tennis plaier that comes well beaten out of the tennis court, yet to comfort himſelf, and to ſaue his poore credit with his friends, brags that thoſe mates with whom he plaid, were no matches for him: yea that no man that daie was able to ſtand in his hands: Even ſo M.

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:2473:186"/> had returned my owne bals vpon mee, &amp; that with very great advantage. well, bragge is a Iolly dog, and leeſers muſt ſometimes bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to haue their words. Let the iudicious and indifferent reader but weigh well, firſt, what kind of reſemblance M. Abbot endevored to make betweene the Donatiſts and the Papiſts: to wit, <hi>to chalenge to themſelues to bee the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church: To bee, or rather to deſire to bee dilated all the world over: that out of their church there was no ſalvation; To spred ill rumors of their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: To diſcourage men from ioyning with them,</hi> with a Ragmans roll of ſuch rotten riff raffe common to all ſects, and to none more vſuall then to the proteſtantes themſelues; So tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall I ſay, that any man of ordinarie diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would haue been ashamed to haue put them downe in print to the view of the world. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward on the other ſide let him but call to mind, what reſemblances I haue propoſed betweene the Proteſtants and the Donatiſts, and weigh how ſubſtantiall they bee in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and how properly they fitt the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. The firſt was, that the ſpirit and ſoule of Donatiſme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſted in affirming the church of Chriſt not to appeare in any other part of the world viſibly, but to haue clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perished, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſome few places where men of their religion liued: Of the ſame mind were the chief proteſtants for many yeares. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Donatiſts were the firſt among Chriſtians that appealed from the iudgment of Bishops vnto temporall Princes, though
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2473:187"/> they afterwards repented themſelues the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, when they ſaw that the ſaid princes would not helpe them. Is not this one of the chiefe heads of the proteſtants Goſpell? yea doth not the whole frame of their new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hang vpon the ſupreme eccleſiaſticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of kings? Thirdly, they beate downe Altars, abuſed the bleſſed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſts body, defiled holy oiles, confiſcated ſacred chalices, and ſold them, togither with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtments, and other holie ornaments of the church. All which are ſo proper to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that they blush not daily to practiſe it, and make open profeſſion of the ſame. 4. The proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (like vnto the Donatiſts) by putting innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prieſts to death, make martirs, whom we may worship. Finally they pulled of the veiles of religious women, which were ſignes of their profeſſed virginity, expoſing them to the hazard of the wild world. In which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie and irreligious practiſe, the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue gone farre beyond the Donatiſts.

                     <p>MIſtake I did in ſome circumſtance, but lie I did not, becauſe to lie is to go againſt a mans owne mind and knowledge. That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts were at ſquare with the ancient church of Rome wee confeſſe: But what is that to the latter church of Rome, which is degenerated from the old, and in tying the Catholike church to her ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne place and function doth rather reſemble the old Donatiſts? beſids the Donatiſts were at as great ſquare with all other Catholike churches, ſome of which were alſo mentioned by ſaint Auguſtin in that and other places: why then doth M. Bishop make that peculiar vnto the church of Rome, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich S. Auſtin leaueth indifferent to that and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches? and as other churches afterward became chaires of peſtilence, ſo might the church of Rome, for ought that S. Auſtin there ſaith of it. The like is to bee anſwered vnto Optatus, who te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching the Donatiſts to haue been whole enemies vnto the church of Rome, doth not hinder but that the latter church of Rome might agree well enough with them. Finally S. Auſtin doth not ſay, that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilianus ioyned with the church of Rome alone, but ioyning with that and other Catholike churches, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to care for the Donatiſts. So that there is no more there for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church of Rome, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of other churches. Hee will ſay, that a principality is there attributed vnto the church of Rome: I anſwere as before I haue done, that a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of honour may bee give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it, but not a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of power. And doth it follow that becauſe the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2473:189"/> principality of the Apoſtolike chaire florished there till that time, therfore it should do ſo ever vnto the worlds end? Theſe are looſe and vaine collections vnfit to ſtablish the conſcience of ſober and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men.</p>

                     <p>FOr a concluſion of this chapter M. Abbot tells vs, that albeit hee miſtooke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, yet hee did not lie in any part therof; and the proofe in part is very prettie: <hi>becauſe (for ſooth) hee went not againſt his owne mind.</hi> His mind and pleaſure then being to ſay, that the Donatiſts taught the true church to bee only at Cartenna; Secondly, That the Papiſts do teach now that the ſame true church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned within the wals of Rome only; 3. That no other mans Baptiſme beſids a papiſt prieſts is avaylable to Salvation; 4. That none among the Indians bee truly converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, but all of them are forced to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue baptiſme with out religion; when hee (I ſay) wrote theſe and twentie mo ſuch like moſt luculent lies, yet in all this hee did not once lie; the reaſon is in readines, bicauſe hee never went againſt his owne mind: His mind then giving him (belike) that to vilify and ſlaunder the Papiſts, he might tell a hundreth worſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of them then thoſe are. Good Sir, if vpon Etymologies of words you preſume to deliuer ſuch ſenſeles and wicked doctrine, it may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bee ſaid to you for ought I ſee <hi>Domine men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiris,</hi> whether you teach it againſt your owne
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2473:189"/> mind or no. For although a man that of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ignorance telleth an vntruth, doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly lie; yet when hee preſumeth to shoote his bolt, &amp; to giue his cenſure rashly of things commonly ſpoken of contrary to the truth, as M. Abbot hath done: then hee may bee ſaid to lie, though hee know not perfectly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie; Becauſe hee might and ought to haue learned out the truth therof, before hee preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to deliuer his Iudgment theron in ſuch abſolute and peremptorie tearmes.</p>
                     <p>As the Donatiſts were at open warre with the old church of Rome: So doth the moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne church of Rome, as greatly as the old, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the ſame poſitions of the Donatiſts. To wit, that the church of Chriſt is perished all the world ouer, ſaving in ſome odd corners. 2. That men baptiſed by vnſanctified Miniſters ought to bee rebaptiſed. And ſo of all the reſt, which either Optatus or S. Auſtin then recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſpeciall points of the Donatiſts doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. That the now church of Rome doth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in any one article of faith from the ancient, is that which M. Abbot doth often ſay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate, but never yet could, nor here after shall ever bee able to bring any one ſufficient proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe therof, wherfore by all right and reaſon, the ſaid church is to retaine her former good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and credit, with all honeſt and vpright conſciences. For if everie man haue title vnto his good name, vntill hee bee conuicted to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue committed ſome ſuch fault; as meriteth the loſſe therof: much more the church of Rome,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:2473:190"/> (being the moſt honorable congregation of Chriſtendome) ought to hold her due eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and credit, and enioy all her priviledges, vntill it bee lawfully proved, that it hath iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſerved to bee deprived of them. for, <hi>in dubijs, mel or eſt conditio poſsidentis.</hi> In all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cauſes shee that is and hath been fifteen hundreth yeres in poſſeſſion, is to keepe it ſtill. I grant that when S. Auſtin either defended the honour of the church of Rome, or magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſociety and communion with it, did thervnto ioyne ſome other church: But the mention of them not being to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what reaſon had I to recite that which was needleſſe? when as every man knowes that aſwell as then, ſo now, whoſoever shall reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile himſelf to the church of Rome, hee shall therby reenter into communion with all other Catholike churches throughout the whole world. And wheras M. Abbot would haue his credulous reader ſuppoſe, that S. Auſtin made no more reckoning of the church of Rome, then hee did of any others; That is flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that which S. Auſtin ſetteth downe in the very ſame place, who to prevent that Cavill, doth enterlace this Parentheſis in the honour of the church of Rome <hi>(where alwaies florished the primacie of the Apoſtolicall chaire.)</hi> And in his Epiſtle 165. being to giue an inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of paſtors in the church, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth choice of the church of Rome, as of the better aſſured and more ſafe and ſound, &amp; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re doth intimate that the Bishops of Rome,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:2473:190"/> though they might liue amiſſe, yet should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faile to inſtruct aright all that ſeeke vnto them for reſolutions of their doubts in matter of faith. wherfore M. Abbot if hee will giue credit vnto that moſt holy and learned Doctor (whom aſwell proteſtants as wee do eſteeme for one of the ſoundeſt recorders of antiquity) hee muſt needs yeeld vnto the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; both that it is the principall of all the reſt, and that it shall for ever continue the moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Oracle of the holy Catholike faith. w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich if hee refuſe to do, hee leaueth apparent proofe vnto all the world, that hee had rather with the Donatiſts raile at her and revile her; then with S. Auguſtine and other holy prelats, extoll and magnify the primacy of that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall chaire, and defend the ever durable ſucceſſion of her paſtors, as wel in truth of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as in order of perſons. of which I haue more largly ſpoken in the 2.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ECAVSE M.

            <list>
               <item>I. Firſt whether hee that beleeueth aright in the one living and eternall God, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth honeſtly, may bee ſaued without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe beliefe in Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour.</item>
               <item>II.

               <item>III. Thirdly, I will adde a word or two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the publike profeſſion of the ſame Chriſtian faith: becauſe beſides an honeſt life, and a true belief, that alſo is neceſſary, to ſalvation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I tooke it not amiſſe to handle briefly the firſt point, although there bee few Chriſtians that make any doubt of it; becauſe I my ſelf haue heard ſome good ſoules verie vertuouſly given, but not ſufficiently inſtructed, to bee of opinion that it made no great matter what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they profeſſed, ſo they feared God and led an honeſt life amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their neighbors. Their opinion ſeemed to iſſue out of Good nature, and a great loue of honeſt life and vpright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which they ſaw to bee wonderfully deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied, and almoſt perished in our miſerable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. The beſt reaſon that I can frame in favour of their error is this: Almightie God is moſt mercifull, full of goodnes and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:2473:192"/> all his owne creatures, hee knowes our inbred ignorance and weaknes, and therfore is not likely to bee highly offended againſt them, that do their endevour to ſerue him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to their knowledge and capacitie, how ſlender ſoeuer it be: Now manie there bee in the wide world brought vp among Turkes &amp; infidells that never heard of, or at the leaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſufficiently declared vnto them, that Ieſus Chriſt is the Saviour of the world: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeemes that ſuch may bee ſaued without faith in him. And among vs Chriſtians ſome bee ſo dull of capacitie and blockish, or haue been ſo extreame ignorantly or evilly brought vp, that they haue not been well taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the Saviour of the world, Chriſt Ieſus; may not their groſſe ignorance beg their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don att our moſt mercifull Lord his hands? Beſides S.

God (I grant) will not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne anie man for not beleeuing that which hee neuer heard of: wherfore if in any coaſt of the world the Doctrine of Chriſt bee not ſufficientlie published, no man there shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for not beleeuing in him; but for other mortall &amp; grieuous offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, which they haue in their life time comitted againſt the lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht of reaſon &amp; law of nature.

Among Chriſtians there can hardly bee found anie one (I think) ſo vngratiouſly bred, that neuer heard of Chriſt: becauſe that is contained in the Creede that all Chriſtians are taught even from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, and are bound to know, ſo farr fourth as their capacitie and wit will giue them lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue: which if they should neglect to learne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they come to yeares of diſcretion, they are worthie to bee depriued of all benefits iſſuing and growing by Chriſt, becauſe they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſomuch as to know him. To that text of S. Paul, that hee who cometh to God, muſt know that hee is, and that hee is a rewarder, &amp;c. I anſwere firſt, that the Apoſtle ſaith ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well, that hee muſt know thoſe two points, but hee doth noth ſaie there, that hee needs to know no more: And elſwhere in all his Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les doth teach that ouer and beſides that, the faith in Ieſus Chriſt is neceſſarie for all men. wherfore this point muſt bee added to the reſt. I anſwere ſecondly, that one cannot know particulary how God is a rewarder, vnles hee know the incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt. becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe God will reward no man with life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, but through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, and for that hee is a member of Chriſt, and for ſuch good works, which a man without faith in Chriſt; and without aide of his grace ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not performe. Thus much of the firſt point</p>
            <pb n="381" facs="tcp:2473:195"/>
            <p>Now to the ſecond, which is the principall queſtion. <hi>whether holding the right faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and beleeuing the other fundamentall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which are conteyned in the Apoſtles creed, one may bee condemned for not beleeuing any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Chriſtian faith.</hi> For the plainer expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſtate of this queſtion it is to bee vnderſtood, that many of the vnlearned and ſimpler ſort, maie bee ignorant of many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appertaining to faith, without daunger of damnation; becauſe by reaſon of their lacke of capacitie, or for other neceſſarie occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s about getting of their poore livings, they are not bound to know expreſly much more then is deliuered in the Apoſtles Creed, and what doth concerne the right vſe of the ſacraments which they themſelues are obliged to receiue. Nevertheles euerie Chriſtian man and woman may verie well bee bound not to defend the miſbeliefe of anie one article of faith, after hee shalbee given to vnderſtand that the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke church hath declared the ſame to be ſo. There is a great difference betweene the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of two ſuch parties, for it is one thing to bee ignorant what the church teacheth in ſuch a caſe, and another not to bee willing to beleeue it, abeit hee knew well enough that the church commaundeth him ſo to beleeue. In the former there is a ready good will to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the truth, aſſoone as due information shalbee given him, and meere ignorance in the meane ſeaſon hindreth his conſent. But in the other partie there is a looſe libertie of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:2473:196"/> what him liſteth, and an obſtinate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion not to beleeue and obey the church any further then they themſelues shall thinke good. Theſe men I ſay albeit they beleeue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Ieſus Chriſt touching his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and mediation, and do not deny anie arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Apoſtles Creede, at leaſt as they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; yet do they dwell in the ſtate of damnation, and shall not bee ſaued vnles they repent. This propoſition I know will ſeeme ouer rigorous and terrible vnto many, but being a matter of eternall ſaluation or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at leaſt as I take it, they muſt giue mee leaue, that preferre the honour of Gods truth before the phanſies of men and the care of their ſalvation before currying of falſe favour with them, to aduertiſe them of it whiles they haue time to take heed to it, requeſting them to conſider well of the reaſons that I shall now deliuer vnto them in proofe of the ſame, and then I truſt in God they will alſo come to bee of my opinion therin. The firſt may bee thus propounded. If it were ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to beleeue in Chriſt, and in the other articles of the Creede (as they take them,) this great abſurdity would enſue therof; that all heretikes anciently condemned were vniuſtlie condemned, &amp; might well notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their hereſies and condemnation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue liued and died in the ſtate of ſaluation: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich to imagine were to condemne all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox churches, and ancient fathers, of great
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2473:196"/> impiety, and extreame want of Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I will proue that abſurd ſequele by the enumeration of the moſt notorious Heretikes. The Arrians (for example) did profeſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, ſo farre forth as is deliuered in the ſaid Creede. To wit, that hee was the only ſonne of his father, borne of the virgin Mary and our Lord. They did indeed denie him to bee <hi>conſubſtantiall,</hi> that is of the ſame ſubſtance with his father, and <hi>coeternall.</hi> but thervpon diſcourſed much like as ſome Proteſtants do now about Tranſubſtantiation, who profeſſe Chriſts bodie to bee really preſent in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe Chriſts words do teach that plainly; but they will not admitt of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> in any caſe; for that they find not that word ſet downe in the ſcriptures. So thes Arrians did profeſſe to beleeue Chriſt to bee the Saviour of the world, to bee alſo the ſonne of God trulie and really, yet becauſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re was no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Conſubſtantiall</hi> in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therfore they were content to beleeue ſo much as was in the ſcriptures, but their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences (forſooth) would not ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture one pace beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the expreſſ word of God. Notwithſtanding their faire pretence they were roundly condemned by the church in the firſt generall councell for moſt damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heretikes, if vnder that pretext they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leeue that Chriſt Ieſus was conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall vnto his father, and coeternall.</p>
            <p>The Neſtorians beleeued all that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2473:197"/> church taught of our ſaviour Chriſt Ieſus, and of all the other articles of faith, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they held him to haue two diſtinct perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, aſwell as hee had two differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t natures. To wit, the nature of man to haue had his owne perſon of man, euen as the nature of God had the perſon of God. The <hi>Apollinariſts</hi> did not ſwarue from the Catholiks in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point of faith, except that they maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our ſaviour Chriſt to haue had no ſoule of man, but that his Godhead did ſupplie the place of the ſoule. Eutiches and his fellowes agreeing in the reſt, auouched the flesh of Chriſt to bee turned into the divine nature. All theſe did profeſſe to beleeue in Chriſt, and to hold all the articles of the Creede. So did the Macedonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that imagined the holy Ghoſt to be leſſe then the ſonne. And the latter Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians alſo, that deny the ſame holie Ghoſt to proceed aſwell from the ſonne as from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Pelagians did not denie Chriſt or anie article of the Creed; no more did the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians nor the Donatiſts, at leſt as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the creed. For albeit the Nouatians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied prieſts to haue power to forgiue ſome certen of the moſt grieuous ſort of ſins, as the Proteſtants do now denie them to haue power to forgive any at all: yet they denied no more then the proteſtants do, that article of the creed, <hi>I beleeue remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that God could at all times forgiue all ſort of ſinnes, though they denied prieſts to haue power to remit ſome of the moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:2473:197"/> So the Donatiſts though they taught the church to haue been decayed all the world ouer ſaving in Africa, yet did they profeſſe to beleeue the <hi>Catholike church:</hi> But they expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded it to bee Catholike, not for that it was ſpred ouer all, but for that it reteyned all the ſeven ſacraments, or for that it profeſſed to keepe all Gods commaundements, as you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue heard before. Out of theſe examples I fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me this argument. If it were ſufficient to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beleeue in God our Creator, and in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Redeemer, withall other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſet downe expreſly in the Apoſtles Creed, Then were the Arrians, Macedonians, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, and all thoſe other aboue rehearſed he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, notwithſtanding their obſtinate clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to their condemned hereſies, in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of ſaluation: becauſe they refuſed not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any of the foreſaid points: But to hold that anie of the aboue named heretikes, dying in their ſaid hereſies, died in the ſtate of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to gainſay and reproue all pure anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, it is to condemne the holy prelats and moſt learned Doctors of the primitiue church of want of learning, want of Iudgment, and want of charity; who caſt thoſe erring men, as heretikes, out of their churches; condemned them to the pit of hell, as the profeſt enemies of Chriſt, and the Devils champions. Beſids the beſt informed Chriſtians of thoſe times choſe rather to ſuffer all kind of torments, then to profeſſe any one point of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned opinions; which had been great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2473:198"/> if with the profeſſion of them they might (holding the other fundamentall points) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue enioyed Chriſt his fauour, and been inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors of the kingdome of heauen. Moreouer, what neceſſity had there been for the moſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned and renowmed ancient prelats to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue taken ſuch paines, either in writing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned volumes, or in diſputing or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching againſt thoſe heretikes, if they might haue been all ſaued euery one in his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Might not alſo the huge charges and exceeding great paines of aſſembling of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councels haue been well ſpared, if thoſe men for whoſe right information they were called, might haue obt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ined ſaluation, though they had been let alone in their owne errours? It muſt needs therfore bee graunted, that the beſt Clerks, and holieſt perſonages in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times of Antiquity thought it enough to damnation, to deny anie one article of the Catholike faith,<note place="margin">

But becauſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings neuer wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t falſe prophets to lay pillowes vnder their elbowes to vphold them in their errors, ſome ſuch may heere ſtep forth, and in their excuſe ſaie for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſeing they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in Chriſt, &amp; hold all the articles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creede, though they erre in other points, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee heretiks, &amp; therfore whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is ſaid againſt heretikes, doth not touch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be not of that nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. This excuſe will not ſerue the turne: for as I haue before shewed, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Arrians, Neſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Pelagia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor any other moſt notorious heretikes did plainly denie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt to bee Saviour of the world, nor
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2473:199"/> anie other expreſſe point of any article of the creed? neuertheleſſe they were by the true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the ancient Catholike church denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and declared for heretikes. In a word if to beleeue in Chriſt, and to hold the reſt of the Apoſtles Creede, were ſufficient to preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue any Chriſtian from the Canker of hereſie; then hee that would denie both the old and new Teſtament to bee Canonicall ſcriptures, and the true word of God, might bee no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike: becauſe the Canon of holy ſcripture is not expreſſed in the creed. So hee that would ouerthrow the whole Hierarchie of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, and ſend all the ſacraments into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might eſcape the brand of hereſie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe points there is no particular mention in the ſaid Creed. wherfore it is moſt certaine, that men may bee moſt wicked and damnable heretikes, albeit they profeſſe to beleeue in Chriſt, and do not deny anie one ſubſtantiall point expreſſed in the Apoſtles Creed, if they shall wilfully defend any other erronious doctrine, contrary vnto the truth reuealed by God, and ſo declared vnto vs by the paſtors and doctors of the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch. For witnes wherof I will now cite only two, leaving the reſt for the vpshot of this queſtion:<note place="margin">Aug l. q. in Math. q. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> the one shalbee the great Doctor of the church S. Auguſtin, who as I haue once before shewed, doth teach in formall tearmes <hi>that perſon to bee no member of the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, who doth beleeue obſtinatly anie falshood in matter of faith, knowing it to bee ſuch.</hi> And the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:2473:199"/> ſecond shalbee Martin Luther, whom albeit wee take for an Apoſtate Auguſtine frier, yet the proteſtants eſteeme him as a great man of God. Hee for want of one article of beliefe condemneth all the Sacramentaries to the pitt of hell, theſe bee his words. <hi>It shall nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the Sacramentaries to ſpeake of ſpirituall eating, nor to beleeue in the father, the ſonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luther lib. quod verba Chriſti Stent.</note> 
               <hi>and the holy Ghoſt, ſo long as with blaſphemous mouth they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie this article of faith, which Chriſt hath propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vs by his owne holy mouth: This is my bodie that shalbee giuen for you.</hi> Behold, no ſaluation to be poſſible, if you deny but that one article of faith.</p>
            <p>Among manie other cauſes, why ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers are eſteemed worthy of ſo grievous punishments, there bee two principall: the firſt is, that they will not beleeue God himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his diuine miſteries vnto vs; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe they will not giue credit to the church propoſing vnto them the ſame truth. All Divines hold that there is no matter of faith, which is not reuealed vnto vs by God himſelf. whether the ſame veritie had need to bee put downe in writing, as the proteſtantes ſeeme to require; or that it ſufficeth to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by word of mouth, as we hold, is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betweene vs: But wee all conſent, that what ſoeuer is propounded vnto vs to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, muſt needs bee firſt reuealed by God. whence it followeth evidentlie, that hee who denieth to beleeue any one article of faith, is conuinced not to beleeue God himſelfe in that

For as S. Iames diſputeth. <hi>Hee that hath kept the whole law beſides, and doth offend but in one point therof, is made guiltie of the whole.</hi> Euen ſo hee that beleeueth God in all other articles yet in ſome one refuſeth to beleeue him, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de guiltie of the whole. That is, as S. Iames expoundeth it, offendeth againſt the Maieſty and veritie of the law giuer, not reputing him worthy of credit in all matters what ſoeuer. But to thinke God not worthie to bee credited in anie one word or title, that shall proceed out of his diuine mouth, is in truth to make him no God at all. For hee is no God, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will or can bee vntrue of his word. Here the poore Chriſtian trembling at this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce will crye out that hee doth beleeue God in all things, and God forbid that hee should once imagine him not worthy to bee credited in whatſoeuer it shall pleaſe his diuine maieſty to reueale: But hee will ſay, that hee knowes not that God hath reuealed this vnto him, or at leaſt is not well aſſured that he would haue him to beleeue it. This I grant is the leſſer faut of the two, yet not in any ſort tollerable. For if it hath pleaſed his diuine bounty to reueale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <hi>without a preacher? and how shall any man preach vnto vs, without hee bee ſent?</hi> which is as much to ſay, that without the helpe of ſome bodie ſent from God to teach vs what wee haue to beleeue, wee cannot beleeue aright. wherfore it doth wonderfully much import vs, to make right choice of this inſtructer for ſuch as our guid and director is, ſuch is our faith. If our guide bee blind, wee following him shall blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly fall into the ditch with him. If hee ſee clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, if he bee well aduiſed, ſtaid, and certaine; following him, wee shall be aſſured to walke in the ſtreight path. For example. The Turks beleeue in one God, maker of heauen &amp; earth, as wee do; yet haue they not the true faith the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof as wee haue: becauſe they haue not the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me guid and inſtructer for that article that wee haue. They be led to beleeue that, by the credit which they giue to the miniſters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, who out of his Alcaron teach them ſo to beleeue in God. wee beleeue the ſame, for that the Catholike church doth ſo teach vs in the firſt article of our Creed. Ours is the act of true faith, becauſe wee are directed by the true church that cannot deceiue vs. The Turkes perſwaſion is no act of true faith, for that hee taketh it on the credit of them that may deceiue him: And do without doubt in manie other points deceiue him:
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:2473:203"/> wherfore whether they do in this or no, hee is vncertaine; and conſequently his perſuaſion being vncertaine, hee cannot haue anie true faith, which is certaine and without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. In like manner the Iewes albeit they haue the old teſtament for their foundation, yet being deſtitute of an vndoubtable directer, and taking for their blind guides their Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud and Rabbins, are cleane voide of all true faith; becauſe their perſwaſion alſo relieth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them that may, and do verie often miſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and beguile them. For come to ſome other queſtion of faith, yea to the principall and ground of all the reſt; that is, to beleeue Ieſus Chriſt to bee the ſonne of God, and the true Meſſias and redeemer of the world: The Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke not finding that in his Alcaron, nor the Iew in the old teſtament (according to the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Sinagogue) do moſt blindly and obſtinatlie refuſe to beleeue it. See then of w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat importance the direction of a true ſincere guide is in all matters of faith. wherfore it hath pleaſed the vnſearchable wiſdome of our bleſſed Saviour, to giue vnto all his faithfull ſervants for a moſt aſſured guide, his beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued ſpouſe the Catholike church,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim</hi> 3.</note>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:2473:203"/> it is great reaſon, that wee should both acknowledge our bleſſed maiſters carefull providence over vs in providing vs ſuch a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de; and alſo take our ſelues faſt bound to obey the ſame holie church, in all her declarations made to that purpoſe. It is not then without exceeding great cauſe that all good Chriſtians even from their infancy are taught to beleeue this, that they neuer afterward faile therin; And that they may the better remenber the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me good leſſon, which doth ſo much import all men to learne perfectly, they do from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce forth make dailie profeſſion therof, when they ſaie in their creed, <hi>I beleeue the holie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church.</hi> That is, I do not onlie beleeue, that there is one holie Catholike church; but I profeſſe to beleeue what the ſame church doth teach mee to beleeue, all and everie arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith, without exception againſt any one of them. for if I do beleeue her in one, and not in another, I am become ſuch a chooſer, as the Latines following the Grecians call <hi>hereticus,</hi> an heretike; and do indeed shew that I do not aſſuredlie beleeue the church, as Gods inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre, but onlie ſo farre forth as I thinke good. And then it may bee asked mee, why I do beleeue her at all, if she do but now and then tell the truth? for it may bee that then shee doth not ſay true, when I do beleeue her. To put vs out of all theſe doubts and difficulties, the ſelected gouernours of the church, the maiſters of the world Chriſtes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y Apoſtles, before they did depart to preach
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:2473:204"/> the Goſpell to all nations, ſet downe this for a moſt aſſured principle of the Chriſtian faith. <hi>I beleeue the holie Catholike church,</hi> to teach all Chriſtians, that in thoſe ſupernaturall miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the kingdome of heauen, wee muſt not leane to the light of nature, or truſt to our owne Iudgments, or follow the adviſe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that will take vpon him to bee a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but hold our ſelues preciſelie to that w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich the holie Catholike church doth teach vs, &amp; obeie her fullie and wholie in all things. Out of the premiſes this argument may bee framed directly to our purpoſe. <hi>No man can bee ſaued, vnles hee follow the direction of the one holie Catholike church in all matters of faith: but they that bee of opinion, that euerie man may bee ſaued in his religion, do not follow the direction of the Catholike church</hi> (which doth teach all men to imbrace and follow one only faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) <hi>wherfore they that will not imbrace the ſaid one only faith, which the Catholike church teacheth cannot bee ſaued.</hi> To make this more plaine and probable, let vs in a word or two examine the ſpeciall meanes that the proteſtants vſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the true vnderſtanding of Gods word, and therby vnto ſaluation. where wee muſt obſerue by the way that wee all agree in this, that there is nothing to bee beleeued, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is not by God reuealed vnto vs. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do hold all that to bee written either in the old or new Teſtament: wherin wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them, teaching all revealed verities not to bee written in the Bible, but ſome of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2473:204"/> them to paſſe from father to ſonne, by word of mouth and by tradition. Of which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence here I doe not diſpute, but wee all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for our ground Gods owne and onely word revealed, written or vnwritten, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how wee come to the true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it. wee ſay by the explication and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Catholike church. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants approue not that meanes, but vnder the colour of mans inuentions reiecting of it, do either leane to their owne iudgment &amp; learning, or follow the authoritie of their chiefe preachers, or els runne to the revelation of the Spirit ſpeaking inwardlie to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Now if none of all theſe bee aſſured mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to attaine vnto the true vnderſtanding of Gods word, then their faith that relieth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally theron, cannot bee aſſured. Some of them in great zeale &amp; ſimplicitie will ſay, that they relie only on the word of God: but good poore ſoules they know not well what they ſaie; for the queſtion being about the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſame word of God, wee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the word to bee for vs, they denying that, and chalenging it to bee for them, who shall iudge whether of our pretentions to the ſame word bee true? they will conferre one texte with another, ſo will wee, and conſider all circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances too; wee will repaire alſo to the originals &amp; haue reſpect vnto the Analogie of faith. briefly wee will vſe all humane dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; pray alſo to God to aſſiſt vs ſupernaturally: yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee haue all done wee come to no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. who shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agree vs? If they would come
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:2473:205"/> with vs to the Catholike churches determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in ſome generall councell, wee should quickly haue an end: but they vpon one vaine pretext or other fly of, and will finally follow no other, then one of thoſe three guids before named: wherof the firſt, which is their owne learning and Iudgment, bee it neuer ſo great, yet they maie miſtake and fall into error. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis enim homo mendax.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> For every man is ſubiect to bee deceiued, ſpecially when they bee in paſſion and ſtriue to vphold and make good their owne conceites againſt others; for then they do oftentimes run aſtray verie ſtrangelie. Secondly, the Proteſtants that relie vpon the reputation and credit of their preachers, how can they ſet vp their reſt vpon them aſſuredlie? for that firſt their maſters being men, may bee deceiued aſwell as other men maie be: and that they are in deed deceiued, not only the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks (who are the farre greater and founder part of Chriſtians) do affirme, but thoſe alſo that they themſelues hold for men of God, do teſtify the ſame. For example Martin Luther with his diſciples repute Zuinglius, Calvin, and all the troupe of Sacramentaries to bee deceiuing maſters, and to erre damnablie in the matter of the bleſſed Sacrament. On tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Sacramentarie proteſtants do all teach that Luther with all his followers erred as in many other points, ſo principally in that matter of the reall preſence. which of theſe two (to omit diuerſe other their contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) shall a poore proteſtant beleeue and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:2473:205"/> follow? both hee cannot, becauſe what the one affirmeth, thother denieth, and each of them ſaith that the other is deceiued. Hee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking them both for true of their words, muſt needs beleeue neither of them, for that the one avoucheth the other to bee in error. Hee maie (leaning to his owne Iudgment and liking) rather follow one of them then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet hee cannot do that, without ſome feare of being deceiued himſelf, becauſe hee hath ſo many euen of his owne ſide to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; wherfore he can haue no faith at all in theſe points. For faith is an aſſured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of that to bee true which you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, without anie doubt or feare of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Let vs now come to their laſt refuge and ſureſt hold (as ſome take it) of the ſpirit, which is indeed the moſt wauering and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine guide of all the reſt. For doth not the Lutherans groſſer ſpirit buzze into their brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that they haue found out the light of the Goſpell? yes I warrant you ſaies euery good Lutheran. Not ſo ſaith the purer and nimblet ſpirit of the Calviniſts: it was but the dawning of the daie that appeared to M. Luther, the light of the Goſpell began then only to peepe vp; but the bright beames therof brake not out, till M: Caluins doctrine glittered. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re brisk ſpirite of the Browniſts, doth aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the nooneday light of the ſame Goſpell shineth onlie in their Horizon. And what shall wee ſay to the Anabaptiſts? who as they bee the moſt frantike of all other, ſo they
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2473:206"/> brag moſt of all, of verie familiar acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with the ſame whiſpering ſpirit; with w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich they are ſo haunted, that they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hourely new illuminations and ſtrange revelations. See I pray you into what endles diſſentions this doctrine of the ſpirit doth lead her folowers. It being then moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that there is ſuch variety, and ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the way of the private ſpirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie man that hath a care of his ſalvation, will I hope take heed therof, and not ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bee abuſed therby.

            <p>Now I come to that third part which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to touch in a word or two, before I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished this chapter. becauſe it is not ſufficient for a good Chriſtian to beleeue all that is to bee beleeued, and to haue a full reſolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to keepe all Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, vnles hee do alſo cary a willing mind to make open profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his faith, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time &amp; place do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, what ſoeuer loſſe of goods, liberty or life, hee is therby like to incurre. I do not ſaie, that euerie vertuous ſoule is bound to lay him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf open at all times, and to all ſorts of men, (though hee may not at anie time deny anie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith, or make profeſſion of any falſe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either the honour of God, or the edification of our neighbor do exact the ſame at our hands, then not to profeſſe our faith openly, is both shamefull before men, and in the ſight of God damnable. The funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall reaſon hereof maie bee gathered out of this; that as it hath pleaſed the ſoveraigne diuine maieſty to reueale many high miſteries vnto vs ſeely mortall creatures, to our excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:2473:212"/> great comfort and inſtruction; ſo it is his bleſſed will and pleaſure, that the ſame bee divulged and proclaimed all the world ouer; that all ſorts of men maie (if they looke well to it) reape the manifold rich benefits that do enſue therof. And contrariwiſe that they who will not giue care and credit thervnto, and make the right vſe of ſuch a pretious and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable offer, tendered vnto them from the Almightie maker of heauen and earth their moſt loving Lord and maiſter, may for that their moſt ſottiſh ingratitude be worthily for euer reiected and caſt of. whervpon it hath pleaſed our diuine ſauiour to teſtify of himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, that one of the principall cauſes for which hee was made man, was to publish and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re thoſe heauenly verities vnto mankind:<note place="margin">

               <hi>for this</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>was I borne, and for this came I into the world, that I may giue teſtimony to the truth:</hi> and for the ſame purpoſe, as hee was ſent himſelf from his heauenly father, ſo did he ſend his Apoſtles and diſciples into all coaſts of the earth, that they might annou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and preach the ſame diuine doctrine vnto all nations.<note place="margin">

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:2473:213"/> good of his neighbor. The firſt reaſon therof may bee collected out of that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thus: if our bleſſed Lord and redeemer Chriſt Ieſus was borne to giue teſtimony to the truth, everie good Chriſtian (that is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely member of his miſticall bodie) muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eds take himſelf alſo to be borne anew to the ſame end and purpoſe, and therfore when ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and place do require it, they muſt either te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the truth publikely, or shew themſelues baſtards and cowards, much vnworthie the name of Chriſtians.

For if one should bee conuented befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the magiſtrate and queſtioned about his faith, if he then do not ſtand to the profeſſion of it, he firſt, depriues Almighty God of that due honour which wee all do owe vnto his diuine Maieſtie; for we shewe our ſelues to feare men, more then him: and do beſides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his truth, and make it contemptible in the eſtimation of the beholders.
